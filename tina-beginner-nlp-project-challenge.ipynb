       "\"Kaggle recommended website for datasets learning data science I have a hard dilemma where I graduated while having a data analyst internship but wished I did a data scientist internship on top of it during college I am guessing that my best route should be to land a data analyst role and then work my way up to a data scientist position as I gain more domain and real world experience working with data working on more projects added on my portfolio Thank you for continuing to share and add to the community I started Kaggle and you make a lot of good points about the benefits for the short and long run with it Awesome tutorial I have a question Why do you log normalize Sibsp and Fare in addition to using StandardScaler What does the log normalization accomplish that the StandardScaler doesn't Let s be honest if your overall objective is to get a job why care about the school Just get the cheapest one and get it over with Any good data sets for a time series project Or anomaly detection Thank you very much Sir This really helped to get me my first internship sir could you please tell me about the background music being used its so motivating and it gives me a pump for pushing myself forward What were your ideas to improve airline flights Just curious Pin my comment Very good advice I like the honest detailed responses Will definitely be dropping you a message when I get some more work done mechanical engineer test comment does being accountable means having a goal and stay true to it I kind of overthink it seeing accountable as a duty for me to stay ethical during programming process Great Content This is what I was looking for Btw What keyboard is that New to your channel and kind of fall in love with all the contents Informative guidelines gave me a feeling of feasibility Great video I just binge watched the whole playlist Just a quick stream question how do you deal with a super wide monitor and sharing your screen at normal aspect ratio with OBS this channel is extremely underrated Hi Is there a way to extract all player's stats in a certain game Hallo i have opened the spyder and I installed the kite Kite has all significant packages such as numpy pandas Great video You and Tina make an awesome duo No wonder this channel has K subscribers Hello I have been following you for a long time and thank you for all the quality content you promote here I want to develop my mathematical foundations for data science here's how I thought I start with the basics of algebra and geometry then linear algebra calculus discrete math operational research and statistics What do you think about this planning This is the first video I've been able to sit through engaged in a genuinely interested and joyful way on the topic of data science You're not gimmicky or salesy Thank you so much hello team I've followed every step redid the whole thing multiple times but the ananke theme doesn't seem to render please help Hi Ken Love the video I am currently an undergrad student pursing an Information Science degree at the University of Maryland I was wondering through my major if I could break into the field of Data Science My second question is that if I want to progress my career in Data Science what would be a good masters degree to compliment my undergrad major Thank you Hey I'm so inspired and the problem is that i don't know anything about data science and i belongs from arts background and i want to start from a zero i hope you get me please tell from where should i start hey Ken thank you for this video it's super helpful I'm an undergrad and am still exploring what I want to do I found data science interesting I just have a quick question are strong math skills helpful in DS Do we need to understand data structures and algorithms for data science What education diploma degree do you have need to become a data scientist Lol which one for someone in there 's with no work experience only an AS degree But who has been programming since they where a child and never been payed for it Who also can and has already built tensorflow keras pytorch and from scratch models It's so annoying to me when videos like this assume everyone watching must have a Bachelors degree already Please share a book recommendation for Data science in AWS and Azure ERROR HELP When changing the Grey small salary to grey salary still no results Went in and inspected the element it is written as CSS uyte CSS hca ks e wijj which should be grey salary If anyone has any insight on this and could help I would greatly appreciate it I'm currently in a full time masters program for data analytics and feeling less than happy with my choice I wish I'd considered all of these things a little bit more before making my choice so that I could have found a program that challenged me in the ways I want Another facet to consider is your actual life situation I'm married I own my home and I live near my university so that definitely influenced my decision I didn't want to sell my home move my family to a new town and then pay out of state tuition but OH HOW I WISH I HAD This was a great video Ken I keep thinking I should share my experiences with people here on YouTube but it feels so nerve wracking Hi this was amazing not only because I m applying in February for fall but also that I m an international student so great bonus as there s no good info online Question though do you recommend taking the GRE The school I m applying to says it s only Recommended and mostly for lower GPA students Thank you for sharing It's not working for me Even after following all the steps in the video I'm getting error while accessing the URL You are a gift Hey Ken Thanks for the honest advice about the data science field Are there any sites you could recommend to get the basic statitics understanding Something like Kaggle com Maybe free Thanks This is very informative thanks a lot Ken Special thanks to Tina her yt channel is so amazing with very helpful content Thanks guys Love this video Ken Tina Anyway I am wondering that do we have take degree in data science major instead of other major Because learning data science can be anywhere online course bootcamp and learning the domains energy finance health are quite hard because we need facilities that we don't have How about my statement Ken Man you're just reading my mind lately hahaha great video as always master master Ken Yay thanks for having me D A resource I wish I had before I picked my masters degree And I need to say again FANTASTIC EDITING Great video as always master master Ken Hey Ken great video I m currently doing my BS in Data Science and plan on getting a full time job when I graduate and have been looking at Georgia Techs Online Masters in Analytics to do part time Do you know anything about this program would you recommend doing the computer science one instead Again nice job It was really helpful Now I understand how a model code should look like and I also learned some tricks There is only one thing I think could have been better Sometimes I couldn't understand what you were doing nor why It felt like I was just watching you code I understand it is hard to explain everything while you are debugging or improving the model but you could have added some explanations while editing Anyway this doesn't take the value of the video Many thanks It was a journey I am about to finish my project and I can't thank you enough Hadn't I followed this playlist my final project would be simply a bunch of code that no one would understand Thanks again Ken Great video Ken on the golden tips for selecting a data science masters degree Oh and did the green dinosaur got bigger Thanks for watching everyone Check out Tina's channel here https www youtube com channel UC UXDak o rBm k Vv dww Watch these videos next How I chose my Masters Degree https www youtube com watch v domVw isGOI ab channel KenJee How Tina Huang Chose Hers https www youtube com watch v C iL V y Qs ab channel TinaHuang Eastern University in PA has a new online masters in data science and the entire cost of the program is By far the cheapest program I have found so far Loved the cameo Tina Huang and Ken Jee it's a collabgiving Charlie Brown The best thing about this video was watching Ken getting stuck trying hard to figure out how to resolve the errors and googling the seaborn code Just made me feel that it is totally okay to not know everything Thank you Ken Hello Ken Nice Video I have a small doubt is it good to have some Tableau Skills to add to Data Science resume I was planning on going through some MOOCs but thought about checking with you once before I proceed ahead Thanks in advance Hey Ken What is the difference between a masters in Data Science vs a masters in Business Analytics If you want to get to the projects straight away go to but you should listen to what he s got to say Great video Do you have any videos about your experience at Depaul I'm enrolling next year I started keeping a journal handwritten of various functions and methods that I knew I would want to use again The journal is long but it made for quick reference when I encounter a problem that I know I ve solved before I think the feeling of inadequacy comes from often seeing the finished work of very experienced people and never seeing the process It almost makes it look like they can do it all in one go without referencing anything This is a good video Tina's advice input on course based masters was definitely useful I wish I knew about that going into my master's program I'm doing research now that my professor plans to get published but it took a lot of work to get to this spot I don't know of any other master's student in my program doing research Tina's right that generally those opportunities are only available for undergrads and PhD students I want to do an independent study in reinforcement learning to close out my last semester next semester but I already know that since I'm not a PhD student or curious undergrad the chances of me getting that opportunity are slim to none I'm hopeful that instead I might just continue to do research under the professor I'm currently working with Course based masters definitely can be good but it's also good to be aware of the possible cons that they can come with and I think this video does a good job of explaining those pros and cons I'll have to add this topic to the list of video ideas I got So does that mean it's necessary to have a degree Start of video is same I look now confused Informative For someone who just this week applied for Datascience course this is gold Great video To grow Weed growing in video Great video and all very relevant points Currently doing my M Sc in Data Science with the university of London I'm also working full time and I will honestly not recommend anyone doing the program full time while working full time if you aren't already working in data science or have a strong base in the field I'm in classes this semester and while I have a strong math background and comfortable programming in python my programming skills are not the greatest and I am new to the Data Science field I have found the time commitment to be a lot Next semester I am definitely not taking more than courses The editing keeps elevating I have a video suggestion best ways to build an online presence as a data analyst scientist Like should it just be git or YouTube and a website What content to put up etc Very informative Hey dear Thank you so much Man the editing was spot on also extremely informative Will definitely follow these steps and revisit this video Thanks Hello sirr I am interested in data science and I am planning to do my masters in abroad like uk and newzeland whether it is good for masters in data science and how is the placement And job opportunity Hey ken loved your video it was very informative this maybe a little unusal story but I have a degree in criminal justice and I would like to have an immediate career change and i was looking into data science data analysis which intersted me on how much you can do I am currently taking on a certificate in data science to see if i am interested and i was wondering how can you create a stand out portfolio for employers with little to no experience in coding or computer science Also will learning data science help get foot in the door into a data analysis position working on programs like R or sql I'm getting some random css number as the span class name css uyte r css hca ks e wijj of the salary estimate When I'm entering that name in the scraper code its returning Any idea how to overcome this Man that was just amazing Actually the web site portfolio was killing some sleep nights and I had no clue on how to do it Than I landed on the first video and now here Really thanks for that It was very well explained and hands on walkthrough Explendid job Just subscribed and I'll be sure be following you Thank you once again Successs Please guide how to remove the share button in the website Like the twitter and facebook icon does not even open Super cool welcome Hi Ken while watching this video I just realized that I'm now part of one data science community Wow thank you for bringing us all together I'm looking forward to more of your videos about Kaggle projects Lately I found one very useful extension of jupyter notebook TOC which automatically creates a table of contents with hyperlinks based on the headings Its link https jupyter contrib nbextensions readthedocs io en latest nbextensions toc README html Once you try it I bet you will love it However it's not available in Kaggle yet The closest thing it has is to display the first level headings on the right in the reading mode There's large room for improvement Louis posted in product feedback on Kaggle six months ago https www kaggle com product feedback but received little attention What a pity Can you help draw more attention and upvote it If you have any other ideas please let me know I strongly believe that getting our sharing notebook well organized and more readable is very helpful for the community TOC will make it much easier Hey mate Thanks heaps for your video such a beauty Would you mind to share or make a video sharing about how you keep your Linkedin Twitter and personal site going I usually find that keeping up with them takes time Cheers H I have Bs degree in computer science years ago from overseas I worked overseas as developper then I worked as an account manager with zero technical coding experience Now I am back to usa from overseas and no luck for landing a job may be because I have foreign degree foreign experiance old bachelorette and outdated technologies I decided to evaluate my foreign degree and go to school for data science master program or go to coding bootcamp to refresh my coding knowledge What do u think suitable for me master or coding bootcampp I live in Chicago and I have a good job as a store manager but I like to be back to the IT environment Hi Ken what do you think the Kaggle projects vs some Bootcamp projects Very instructive video thanks Maybe you can read Sentdex's new book and use the code from that too This video is gold Hey I'm interested in data analysis science too Could you recommend any good books about data analysis in sports I watched a movie Moneyball and it would be good to find out whether doing analysis in sports is useful I'm a huge fan of basketball NBA So if you could give any suggestions I would appreciate it a lot Thank you so much Ken When someone loves the subject and teaches it to others they will also start loving the subject With your detailed unedited video I gained a lot of confidence I used to get overwhelmed with so many terms but seeing you I understood that not everyone knows everything You just have to start with an idea and learn along the way by getting your hands dirty Thank you once again Have a great day Super informative thanks Ken I'm doing Btech in Data Science and Engineering Is it a right pathway to get a data science job Hi would you recommend learning data science or data analytics to start in a sports analytics job Thank you for your insight very helpful I liked how you outlined your goals You crushed your subscriber goal for congrats Heck yeah this was awesome Thanks for sharing your journey Ken Please guide me how to add a pdf file in the project please Bro i just completed my engineering and want to start a career at datascience and i need a good online teching site for datascience you prefer Hi Ken thank you for a great video I am also building a PC GPU first and this video is so relatable I was wondering if the CPU is a bottle neck What is the rating of the power supply you are using Did you add any extra cooling What is the model number of your cabinet If you can shed some light on these it will really ease my decision making Thank you Oh Dang Congrats I remember when you had less than K Keep it up brother Hi Ken Jee I want a short comment about Tilburg University's NL Msc Data Science Society when you have the time Hey man your content is awesome Thank you Very helpful session Looking forward to more of these Thanks P S The questions were visible well enough p And it was good that you made them visible It is nice to be part of this community although I'm not very active thanks to you man Eyyy Chikna Any mechanical engineering structural analysts here with work experience What are you upselling from this experience Hi Ken I was hoping to get your advice on something Well I'm currently getting my Masters in Engineering Management with a Specilization in Analytics I beleive that was the best path for me to take since I want to start out as a Data Scientist and eventually scale over to Product Management This program basically teaches me both skills However I've noticed that there are a lot of MS CS and MS DS majors who apply for these majors Do you think I should change my major to match those or do you think I should remain in the track that I am I still believe once I am done with the program I'll have the same skillset as the other majors I just don't want to get screened out of getting a chance to be interviewed thanks for sharing the whole process including all 'surprises' along the way with error and google searches Most people this that only geniuses can make it This helps to humanize the data science process haha Hi Ken I just started my BS on IT with a minor on Data Analytics I am and worked for many years as a casino manager My goal is to concentrate in the Data Science area I am glad to found your channel you have a new subscriber Thanks Hi Ken nice video I didn't participate in this one but I'll join the discord server and do the next one Quick question what video editing software do you use I see in your description your computer details and the camera you use and I searched throughout your channel to make sure you didn't have a video talking about this stuff so I'm sorry if you get asked this a lot I just am going to be done with my second to last semester of grad school this week and have like months for christmas break so I was going to spend some time learning editing stuff so I can hopefully start my own youtube channel soon enough I can't afford the camera yet but I don't need that to start I've got some ideas and I just am curious to know what software you use to edit your videos Do you have a preamp and a mic with a pop filter you use Thanks Yes I agree going out and getting it WORKS but also creating content bring opportunities to you What does a basic understanding of statistics entail I have got an why don't you and Andrew make a video on begginer pack of daysofdata like roadmap for beginners for days challenge something like that Just a suggestion Ken Jee this was an absolute journey so far I think we can have the version to be more inclined towards practical implementation We can form teams on Discors work towards common goal improving upon the basic we have learnt so far We all can curate a list of projects from multiple domain decide which one to work with whom Would love to hear your thoughts on this Hi I wanted to pull playoff data for lebron james I have pasted my code below Can you let me know what is wrong from nba api stats library parameters import SeasonTypeAllStar colnames 'SEASON ID' 'Player ID' 'Game ID' 'GAME DATE' 'MATCHUP' 'WL' 'MIN' 'FGM' 'FGA' 'FG

informative especially for a non STEM background student like me Data science or Cloud computing I am very confused Can you please suggest cloud computing vs Data scientist Hello sir I am doing Master in Computational and Data Science I am currently learning some subjects like scientific computing parallel computing algorithm engineering mathematics models for optimization problems I want to know how important are these subjects in Data Science and Machine Learning because i want to deep into DS and Ml thanks Hi Ken What are the chances of getting into USA Canada Germany with low profile for Master's in Data Science My background is yr engineering in Information technology I am currently in my final year done virtual internship during pandemic from Microsoft and Deloitte Have lots of online certification on Python ML ANN CNN NLP etc My profile is GPA TOEFL GRE Targeting fall I am going to apply in UCSD TAMU SUNY BUFFALO Lakehead RWTH What are your thoughts on my profile Is it good enough to get admit Should I go for it or should I just wait for year and prepare myself more in exploring DS Hello Sir I want to start my MS career in Data Science I need your help sir Great as usual I've a question I don't have a college degree neither in computer science or mathematics but just paid courses and I'm learning constantly from kaggal is a college degree in CS and Math is a must to become a data scientist or a professional portfolio works Tips for real and wannabe data scientists don t become I diva and learn how to program properly Next learn a proper programming language that is performant and productionasible That's great I think mastering the skill of working on projects and uploading and using them in making a powerful personal portfolio is the keyword of being professional in the field and getting finding good job so plz we need more of that staff Thank u so much for this series it really gives me a lot of insights Hello sir I am doing Master in Computational and Data Science I am currently learning some subjects like scientific computing parallel computing algorithm engineering mathematics models for optimization problems I want to know how important are these subjects in Data Science Machine Learning and Deep Learning because i want to deep into DS and Ml Hello sir I am doing Master in Computational and Data Science I am currently learning some subjects like scientific computing parallel computing algorithm engineering mathematics models for optimization problems I want to know how important are these subjects in Data Science and Machine Learning because i want to deep into DS and Ml Ken I understand the value of understanding the data you are working with but could you explicitly tell us what are the outputs you expect from an EDA and how it impacts the outcome of the model and of the project in general I've just started with Kaggle course on basic Python that's amasing Thank you for all your tips This comment stood out to me the most Maybe it's more about the critical mass of what you create than the growth of the videos To me it speaks to cultivating internal motivations having an internal locus of control and understanding that above all else you must do the work And thanks for your answer to my questions Ken I can certainly appreciate the wisdom in planning in broad strokes and letting life fill in the details Hi Ken love your videos Got a question for web scrapping tho Maybe I'm missing it but what should I be looking out for in the robots txt about scraping I pulled up the glassdoor one on my own but not sure which line says to not scrape Maybe I'm missing it or don't really know what to look for If youre aiming at becoming a machine learning ai engineer Do you think that its a good idea to work as a data scientist without spending much time on machine learning at first and than specialize on these subjects i work as a data analyst rigth now for a short time For statistics I would recommend the books of Geoff Cumming instead abandon p values and embrace confidence intervals If you're new start with Introduction to the New Statistics otherwise have a look at Understanding the New Statistics His website is great with cool stuff www thenewstatistics com and he has also made some nice videos www youtube com user geoffdcumming videos check the Dance of p values or Significance roulette Thanks for recommending this book it was an intuitive and easily digestible read Practical Statistics for Data Scientists t Thank you ken Jee for DaysOfData I learned a lot in this challenge Made projects using Tableau SQL Python Got to know about the data science lifecycle Looking forward for the next DaysOfData To be honest a person who can wield two swords is the one who is the most deadly I like to leverage both in my workflow R gives me beautiful visualizations and rapid fast data cleaning with tidyverse packages and I can use python for fitting machine learning models with sklearn and dimensionality reduction as well as neural networks Both have their benefits and I don t think one should use just one vs the other Loved the intro for this one Set a really nice vibe for the rest of the video Thank you I was really happy following it daysofdata I am having a master in Computational and Data Science I have a lot of subjects like scientific computing parallel computing algorithm engineering Can you please tell me how important are these subjects in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning since i want to deep into those areas Hey Ken I did a quick quantification of the daysofdata hashtag here https github com dungates TwitterStats blob master daysofdata md Subscribed I enjoyed reading your goals on the wall Thanks for the info Why tho I started following you before a week Lucky that i found a channel which is really of my type I really believe connecting is the key whatever amouny of technical excellence you have Here we just get the right mix of technical and non technical stuff for our self development I started implementing many of the corrections you told But sometimes I literally go off mood and the day just becomes a void I agree the next iteration will be even better I also struggled with creating a clear concise plan for my journey Now that I have a Notion template to document plan thanks for linking the one I created btw I know that I will be even more productive during the next round and the slow zoom in on your dad taking care of business on the laptop was so funny hahaha love the mix of comedy in your videos Let's gooooooo The thumbnail Love your stuff man Because of you and Daniel Bourke I landed my first Data Science job Also just bought the Ken's Nearest Neighbor shirt being a fellow Ken and all lol Hey Ken When I started the days of data challenge my goal was to learn deep learning I was going to learn it through some paid resources but little did I know that posting everyday would open doors to have recruiters talk with me I got to speak with recruiters from Amazon Facebook and a consultancy group I have now pivoted to Computer Vision as the niche I want to focus on I look forward to doing this again in January The daysofdata challenge is actually helping me to get though with my degree thesis too Seeing as I was doing the min even if I was tired from work I told myself If I can do I can do and then set an extra goal of min of daily thesis progress Some days are harder than others but it's working and I plan to finish it by February and that's something a need to thank you for Ken You really are an inspiration Ken please answer my query I am a SE with year of experience I am learning ML DS since around months and recently I talked to the management of my company for transition to data science They referred me to some research papers related to the respected domain which had seriously complicated math look at it https www researchgate net publication Impact on inventory costs with consolidation of distribution centers I am really overwhelmed with all this and am kind of scared by looking at the same What should I do Shall I drop the idea of becoming a data scientist or apply in other places with different domain Thanks for watching everyone I hope you will join the DaysOfData in the future Links I mentioned Medium Writeup https towardsdatascience com why im starting

great job my man I joined the initiative and lasted maybe days This year has been really rough but I've always had a problem finding the motivation to self teach My personal lesson that I learned was to take the mins a day to heart My flawed plan at the beginning was to spend hours everyday watching recordings of a bootcamp course I took to refresh my memory on coding then dive into projects I got burnt out super fast and part of that was because I wanted to match the impressive strides I saw so many people making on Discord I'll definitely pace myself better next time and not be stingy and actually buy an online course And I'll definitely be looking forward to joining in at the beginning of next year for the next initiative with all of these improvements in mind Great video Love the T rex There s Do i need to install python too if I have anaconda Thank you so much for mentioning my Journey right there Ken I really appreciate it and I still remember that you support my idea at the very moment when I was confused to add on GitHub or not Yeah This Journey taught us a lot and I am proud of myself that I spend my time with many amazing persons Honestly you are the inspiration for us and excited about the next Journey as well I didn't knew about it when it started so I will do now Next project days of gains Hey Ken I'm also Ken ehe Hope to be a Data Scientist Analyst someday Thanks for videos it gladly helps me and motivates me to enter to this industry Kudos to all So the extra finger you'd like to have is pinky As usual nice to see you Keep inspiring us Hi Ken I'm looking forward to the next days on linkedin I had planned to join in the last one but had trouble with twitter Oh man What an excellent and beautiful video I have learned so much these past few months become so much better it blows my mind And it wasn't just Machine learning either That being said being part of the daysofdata community has certainly been a very large contributor to this so many thanks for the opportunity And one thing that I found that helps for practically everything is something that I learned while watching a very old movie named the Silent Flute The script was originally written by none other than Bruce Lee who died before he could shoot it It was taken over and the 'master' was played by none other than David Carradine And despite showing its old age it's full of wisdoms One of them in particular struck a major cord inside me when David Carradine playing the master who according to his student seemed to know everything he simply answered with this Every time the sun rises like the student on their first day of school I open a blank page in my mind to write the lesson of the day After which I wrote this on a blank page and added and have an actual real blank page ready to write the lesson on it I started this on the th of may and well still doing this every single day It's incredible how much you can learn about everything when doing this little exercise and I certainly do like to mention Machine Learning here and there Like say pointing out the importance of iterations in practically everything you can do and learn in life Or use lessons I learned from something else say art and apply them to my Machine Learning studies The kind that says sometimes it's good to switch to something different not only does it allows you to go back later with a fresh mind but even better for all you know the other project you'll be working might give you ideas for the first one Just watching this video is bringing back to memory some of the stuff that I have written in this 'book of wisdom' of mine and makes me want to say so many things about it that I won't do it This post is already getting very long as it is sorry for the wall of text come to think of it I need to write one on how to try to summarize my point of views much more briefly Good luck to everyone for not just your daysofdata not your daysofdata but why not your alifeofdata It's much effective Just google everything first YES And yes I also suffered from not starting with a plan or consistently sharing what I actually did learned Oops I delegated the first part to kaggle Data Camp etc and that just isn't long term sustainable or even short term optimal No regrets though I like the way Ken Lee is replying to every comment Your effort will always be appreciated I definitely was not expecting that wink Loved it lol Thanks for making these kinds of videos D Loved the session really helpful and learned a lot Many thanks Ken for your live program which i watched later Time zones btw the US and Oz make it difficult to watch live You are doing an amazing job paving the way for future data scientists Great mentoring Congratulations on your achievements OH NO I MISSED IT This is awesome Ken Jee Congratulations for the K Way to go How do you reply too many comments all of them on your videos Its too hard But your are doing a good job keeping connection with your viewers Thanks alot Hey Ken I have a year gap while trying for a job from my mechanical degree It didn't yield me Now I am shifting in Data Science field So what would you suggest I do I already done few courses on Udemy and now I can say I'm familiar with some breath of this field Now what should I do will it be necessary in my case two do master in data science or boot camp OR would just building portfolio and having one or two internship would get me a job Amazing video I got a question don't we need to detect the outlier data in the models or its not a necessary step in calcification Do I need and ABET certification why or why not Can u suggest me which projects are best to build my resume I am very interested in data science i am trying to get an intern as a data scientist Can u also suggest me which companies are best to apply Thanks in advance Hi Ken and Data Professor for this incredible walkthrough Everything went smoothly for me until the end when i got error page Has anyone solved this issue WHAT Good projects cannot be found in your closet laundry desk drawers etc WHY AM I ALWAYS THE LAST TO KNOW More seriously right now it's not so much ideas that I have problems with at the moment it's finding enough data to run them yep that time is closing faster than I thought where I will have to learn to scrape data for myself Especially since many of the ideas I have are around using specific type of pictures loads of them fantasy science fiction also had an idea which will requires 'solar punk' pictures all of that in the name of ART and by using ML o But more likely it will be about scrapping for text especially released scripts from some of my favorite series or old books I wonder if I can do a 'whosdunnit' NLP thingy o so many choices but doesn't choice imply renouncing some of said choices o Thanks for this video Being rejected during many past interviews led to me having similar feelings of imposter syndrome despite past success Great job again As people already mentioned uploading the video without editing enable us to understand the process and be more confident that trial and error is part of the process Also you should add a highlight to that moment when you checked the company foundation date this is a really important sanity check Obs Apply seems amazing I write a lot of bad code to do the cleaning it is embarrassing haha Amazing job Ken I will definitely give you credits for my first project Can you please link your wallpaper Thanks Wonderful I m the polar opposite of everything you said Thanks for this video I recently received my B S in Mathematical Analytics and Operations Research and contemplated grad school due to pandemic job market I just don't believe it would be wise to invest more money in a Master's degree when I already have taken coursework in data science have data analyst internship experience and am taking Coursera courses to improve my technical skillset do companies in the US or Europe hire remote data scientists or analysts from outside the country to work remotely or that role is exclusive for local people and must be in the workplace I am a QA for years and taking MS in Computer science with focus on Machine Learning Do I have a chance of getting or successfully transitioning to a career change Thank you so much for recommending Kaggle I had never heard of that site before You may have just saved me a lot of money lol This series deserves a Netflix production Geat job Ken so helpful Can you talk about master of science in business analytics I am planning to start my masters in busienss analytics during fall What would my course of plan be right now What should I start with first Programming or maths or excel or reporting tools I am planning to start my masters in busienss analytics during fall What would my course of plan be right now What should I start with first Programming or maths or excel or reporting tools What should my career path be to attain a job on sports analytics after completing msba program I have heard msba is less programming intensive as compared to ms in data science How much does that impact in getting a job in sports analytics Hi Ken awesome video for pythoners Couldn't scrap tweets tweets are null Does twitterscraper works with other languages too For example turkish Listen to Ken's Nearest Neighbors on

UCpEJMMRoTIHJ vG q EwqCg Trying to get to k so I can start tagging YouTube Guests hey ken wonderful video i was wondering where did u get the eda data csv file because in the past video we didnt save any csv file hey every if yall faced an issue with the nltk downloading namely wordcloud error if u dont have the package use this import nltk nltk download Hi i have followed all the steps yet i couldn't find either anaconda prompt or anaconda navigator in search menu Please help me Please share more about personal projects I have started one but I am not really sure how it should look like at the end and how I should promote it Feel free to pose questions in the comment section here as well Will do my best to get to them all This is very helpful Am interested in learning from the masters Hey Ken can you tell how to study data structures and algorithms for data science Excellent Hey Ken In another video you adviced against putting your picture on your resume One of the reasons is that it may hinder the efficiency of screening apps You advice against putting icons on the resume too for example the icons in https d novoresume com images blogs c d e ca d b efdc it resume png Ken thank you for the information I am leaning towards a masters course Further to your discussion what are your thoughts on getting certified via MS or AWS compared to a master degree To put it in context I have a accounting finance research background Is it better to do a Master's in CS by taking good electives rather than in Data Science Also does location San Jose State or name Georgia Tech matter more if you've just graduated You're really starting to get the hang of this YouTube r business down The editing is looking great with the different camera angles and transitions and stuff Have you considered streaming on Twitch or YouTube for some extra views content Resume reviews portfolio reviews interview advice practice teaching something etc I know you put out that course a while ago Good content in the video by the way I've been using Kaggle to learn some proper ML techniques and their implementations along with when how to use them and also get acquainted with Python more since I'm an such an R junkie Playing with some stock data sets on there has been good for me but I do agree value or good business value comes from gathering some original data or doing something with some impact I'm currently thinking about trying to build a special app thingy currently thinking an RShiny web app that scrapes data information on Yugioh's card collecting valuation website and then so someone can enter what cards they have and how much ignoring PSA value and then it'll autopopulate the current valuation cell next to it or something One small note and I hope this doesn't come across as offensive but I personally thought that the camera angle cutaway transition at around was a bit awkward as it looked like you were speaking but there was an audio lag or something Very well could just be something due to my internet but it took me out a little bit if you know what I mean Nonetheless though great video and great content This channel has been immensely helpful and inspiring to me Keep up the good work Hopefully this large comment adds valuable data to your corpus you're building Sorry for the special characters you'll have to get rid of when you tokenize and clean the data lol Can I get certificate after completing course or project from Kaggle This was helpful But I still wonder where does the actual Science come in to the picture Spending a bit of time to find a good idea definitely is worth it Once you find something you are truly passionate about the motivation can sometimes be limitless In my opinion one great project is worth more than a few okay ones because the passion can really shine through Also awesome intro D Thanks Ken you re the best I m a lawyer who is going to learn data science from scratch I already know a bit of Python thanks to you Keep up the good work man I don't waste my minutes here doing all along what DP's doing Thanks KenJ and Data Professor Hi Ken I have noticed that some master programs in Data science require students to finish a research project while others only require students to finish a capstone project If you are hiring a new grad do you think students with some research experience is preferable This will help me alot just a while ago I was interviewed for a job as a Sports Data Analyst hoping to have a positive result after my interview Amazing editing And super solid advice D Ooohh this video is on next level ken Amazing techniques too Thank you so much for this video It's really useful and I'm going to follow your suggestions D hi professor I was wondering if you can create another video or give a quick answer on how to embed google analytics code into your website I am debating should I modify the code in index html in the public folder I hope you can help me with this question I would really appreciate it Great Playlist Ken This is me Fahad from my other channel where I teach Data Science in Arabic do have a look at my channel there are some English videos Thanks man Keep up the good work Man this series you made is the most important video in my learning by far Thanks to you I realize I'm already can start building projects and work more on my portfolio I was always thinking I'm not ready enough but with your series I realize that I know what to do I can't say how much your series had helped me Thank you IBM data science specialization could land you a job if you also take an applied data science and deep learning specialization All that could potentially take between years depending on your commitment What do you think thanks ken really appreciate the effort in these vids i faced an issue with the state split df 'job state' df 'Location' apply lambda x x split ' ' Traceback most recent call last File ipython input c b e a line in module df 'job state' df 'Location' apply lambda x x split ' ' File C Users itxab anaconda lib site packages pandas core series py line in apply mapped lib map infer values f convert convert dtype File pandas libs lib pyx line in pandas

as all the states are characters at the end Do some more projects ken Thank you so much i have a question that's been bothering me if someone worked on your insightful jobs salary project like started it from scratch and made changes different eda including ann model through out the project and learned a lot from it could they include it in their resume if yes i think we must reference the owner of the idea or is it just better to not include it your project inspired me a lot and made me love data science more thank you so much and hope you will answer my question Awesome series Thanks a lot Hey Ken extremely nice video got an offer from essex university for msc in applied Data Science and also got a offer from stirling university for msc in Ai and AI with business strategy from Aston University Just confused which field to choose as a career option Congrats Ken You have achieved k victory successfuly Hi Ken Great Video I have a doubt though when you say you are creating categories based on the first letter of the cabin why are you ignoring the second letter some have different lettered cabin as the second cabin eg F E Please include congnitiveclass ai it's also very great Nice job Thank you for this I'm tired of spending time watching incredibly detailed ang long video tutorials about data science without actually applying what I've learned to a project Ken is it Data or Data Hahah you use both jk Thanks for the video Informative Video Ken Good info as always definitely liked the analogy to coming up with new business ideas and being more specific Question in the sports analytics industry how much of your time is spent on various activities Maintaining and updating the current data analytics Answering new questions that are brought up by your internal customers Answering your own questions or coming up with new data analytics aproaches to add value love the puns lol Hey ken I am trying to do a project on the past NBA season Do you have any ideas where I could find extensive nba data besides stats nba com Thanks My first ever comment on YT you are that good thank you for these techniques For total newbies like I am that are not looking yet for originality but just build practice basic skills and self confidence in data science few concrete common projects would help a lot I get that it might not be super exciting for experts but your walk through Titanic was great Maybe few more like these Disclaimer I am really at the beginning did not even start the Titanic project yet And what did you find out about your viewers Problem found The subscribe animation still says k followers let's fix that D thx for the video Uber for dogs my business name submission is Duber Great video I loved the creative and comical aspects you add into your videos Solid advice Thanks for watching everyone I'm having a lot of fun with the intros I hope you all like them If you don't I added chapters at the bottom so you can skip it easily Watch these next essential data science projects https www youtube com watch v BBDiadC BvE ab channel KenJee Titanic Tutorial https www youtube com watch v I FBJdiExcg ab channel KenJee DaysOfData https www youtube

process of planning what my next project should be haha I see the new merchandise is up for sale now too Can you become a data scientist without having a degree smashed the like button That intro ken just made the video better In my opinion you should stick to the field you are interested in And data should be complicated enough to be worth analyzing not like two columns But to get both the data and the idea is the biggest problem for me so far I either have the idea but it's nearly impossible to find any decent amount of data or there would be lots of data but on a topic that I've never found the least exciting Sometimes data isn't complicated enough for a project For instance I do monitor used cars sales on a regular basis I just love reading about cars comparing them But the tricky thing is there are like or variables to utilize like mileage color horsepower year produced etc It's more than enough for eda but there is not much room for machine learning project The only interesting idea I came up with apart fromobvious linear regression is to analyze whether mileage is real or not based on the price number of owners etc It seems like some fields are inferior in terms of generating data than others Oo the editing is getting next level Wow the video editing is amazing Ken Lot's of nicely placed puns and humor I totally agree with your advice that coming up with project ideas is a great skill to have In academia one of the most important skills to be acquired during graduate study is essentially this skill of coming up with project ideas finding solutions for solving biological data problems Thanks for breaking down this important topic in a compact and entertaining video Thank you You are like a project guide I also searched for during my Bachelor's degree can you start a SLACK Channel for your community Any Special Surprise Video for k SUB Looks like you are having waaaaay too much fun filming the b rolls Hi Kenji Is there a trade off between projects that are personally interesting vs portfoilo worthy projects Do your projects have to be directly tailored to whatever industry you're trying to get into or is there such a thing as a general data science portfolio Thanks for your videos Another question if we have the funds to pay for a Data Science degree at say Maryville University on line but it is not a masters do you feel that is okay The other option is for my son to finish his current B A in PHHP at the University of Florida and move forward to the Post Baccalaureate degree to get the additional credits needed He would then move on to the B A in C S and finish that degree One is longer and a Public University the other is Private but I belive he can obtain what he needs in Maryville This is the trade off and frankly he hates the PHHP bachelor's and has more semesters and I would like him to just move on One is more time One is more money Please help with advice We have been watching YouTube videos for months you have the best advice Thank you for answers this will help us set our son on the right path forward much appreciated Better than the academic advisors at the Universities I think they have a job to do for the institution and sometimes the truth can not be told or advised Sorry to express that but you have to follow the Money Trail Like in advance Master Master Ken this video was great the quality of your videos is going up Thanks bro hahah Ken is back at it again with his papayas haha Going to be amazing seeing the title but I will go and watch the video now Can you become a data scientist without going to college college is trash Heyy I have got an idea like you can do a Q A video like you can post in youtube community tab and in linkdin to ask them to give questions and you can make a video out of it just a suggestion I'm with a bocherlo's degree in finance and years of experience in the retail bank sector corporate credit risk analyst to be more precise I've always been very curious about programming and data science I even learned some basic coding back in HS What are the odds for me to switch career to data science analysis if I complete a month specialization Tech gig website listed your channel as YouTube channels every Data Scientist and ML engineer should subscribe to Hey Ken great video as always Your videos have really helped guide me through my journey into data science So I thank you for that I'm actually applying to grad schools for next Fall and DePaul's Master's in DS is on the list THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH FOR SUCH VIDEOS I really love them and they make me feel happy and become a data scientist more and more I m a school student with programming background we have learnt python pandas numpy pyplot as well as MySQL course at school we have also learnt about computer networks Next year I plan on to do bachelors in DS years and then masters in DS year although there is one fear that I have which is that I DO NOT COME FROM A MATH BACKGROUND I am ready to learn it tho do you think this could be an issue Thanks a lot Wow man k congrats man you deserve more than millions of milestone What about an international student who would want to get into data science and in the US job market would diploma certificate from canada will help since its budget friendly too Hi Ken I just finished my one year data science study However it seems that I learned many things but I can not apply them well I do not know how should I prepare to find a job Statistics Python SQL and R they are just like familiar strangers to me Can you give me any suggestions I do not know where I should start Thank you So what do you think about a B A in CS So you think you might want to do a B A in Computer Science would a boot camp help prepare you for that Degree Good info what do you mean by a quantitative background God bless Ken Great information I am an SAP Business warehouse developer that uses the SAPs proprietary language ABAP but exposure to coding limited to work exposure SAP's stock tanked since it missed the cloud bus and it has kind of given me a pinch of diversification Does it make sense to invest in learning Datascience and switch gears I tried studying ml on my own there is lot of gaps in my education masters is essential in this field period Accountabilibuddy Very much helpful At some point you may come across the Earth mover's distance and other metrics between distribution functions the Bellman equation in reinforced learning wavelets in data compression and filtering bootstrap and simulation Gaussian processes fortunately for the most part elementary functions will do I know this video is over years old but this opinion sounds kinda odd now when you think of what GPT is already capable to do Especially if you consider it did only basic training till now D Hey could you make a vid explaining how to get a gpu in the cloud in your laptop I have all specs but my gpu is integrated Hi Ken thanks for your insight I'm a Masters in business currently working as a Sr Data Business analyst for a supply chain company I've recently changed my path from being a mechanical engineer who worked in the green energy field I've always been fascinated by code and have quite some background in C I've taken some basic courses in python and have been doing a ton of exercises I'm thinking of progressing to a PM role in the future with the help of some DS certifications Is there any career path advice you can help me with Any insight would be greatly appreciated Thanks hey ken wonderful video i faced an error while copying the data soo many a times i used to get this output x out failed in the middle of the extraction and then suddenly it just paused at like didnt pause but its just stuck there idk what to do ken Datast Do I have to be a software developer or a data analyst first to break into data science or can it be done directly through a masters program or certifications scraping Jupyter Notebook into Spider IDE Hello I majored in Biology in undergrad and I want to switch to data science Can you give me some advice considering that I have minimal quantitative background This is so useful I'm currently learning python because I always got suggested to master it especially the most used libraries for data scientist analyst like pandas numpy etc Is there anyone here who want to get off to learn python too using premium interactive platform I'm using Dataquest Just reply ny comment right away and I'll give you the referral code to get the discount Congrats for k subscribers My goal is to create a chatbot for my coaching business that will kick off on Udemy by next April I just completed a month long Python boot camp and can now begin the real conversation design My roadmap is in a paper I presented last September in Durban SA just as motivation to keep me at it I m a cybersecurity analyst and acquired my master s degree in Linguistics at UGA in I guess I m saying all this to force myself to stay on track and change careers to machine learning No one around me including hubby kids or friends is interested in machine learning enough to make this their second non paying job the way I have as of now Between home family work and an elderly mom in Africa I only have enough time to watch amazing videos like these Thanks so much Ken Ina P S from another video I just listened to I ve had the imposter syndrome all my life Congrats on K subs Love your content ken you are the top Great content man I'm from Peru and I can't stop watching Hey ken what classes would you recommend taking in high school to become a data scientist I m currently in th grade taking honors algebra and ap chemistry and I m really all over the place on classes I should take What types of other classes are recommended for the field Off topic but when I came across the coin toss decision making shtick in the web series Tvf pitchers I had thought that it ws completely original In the past few years we are seeing an explosion in the number of people taking there career in Data Science It has created lots of job opportunities and has helped lots of industries to work better For anyone who start there career in Data Science its often confusing to know what all should they learn to become a good data scientist This article along with the articles written before guides you through the world of data science and help you to become a better data scientist https knowindustrialengineering com tools for data science Hi Ken I m an architect I design buildings I tested out of math in college I m really into computers and very proficient with D modeling I want to switch careers and become a data scientist What do you think would be the best path for me Hey Ken Love your videos bro Can you suggest schools that give weightage to Sports analytics in their curriculum What's with the crazy caption face Hi Kenny how about the DataQuest platform for Data scientists Do you recommend investing money in it Stop with the impostor syndrome Ken your content is good and you seem to be a very nice person smart down to earth and encouraging No wonder your channel is growing hey Ken I noticed from your linkedin that you're based in honolulu how do you like it there pros cons and how is the local data science job market Heyy thankyou for your guidance It's really helps a lot Sorry it's a little lengthy but it's important for us so please read Ken Jee Also as you see there's a significant number of your followers from India so like it's really difficult for us to check which college is best in different countries like US UK Germany which are already quite advanced in this field and will be really beneficial for us if we study there so can you suggest and help us what to do or how to go about it I really wanna study in Germany but you know money is always an issue for an international student so a little bit of guidance in that too please That was a great video Master Ken Glad you ve decided to go with DePaul which sets the first event in the domino effect that led you to posting your first video on YouTube I struggle with things that take a long time If I spend several years to become a master what will I I actually have in the end I will be able to predict some things I guess the hardest thing for me to think about is that years will be gone and will it be worth it Maybe by then AI will do everything automatically Like trying to program an operating system with assembly language or something Thanks so much Ken it's very helpful to outline all the major parts of the project like you did Hey Ken I really appreciate this series but I worry about the dependant variable being the 'Glassdoor Estimate' It seems overly possible that any trends that you find in this EDA are properties of the Glassdoor Salary Estimate algo Anyhow this is great as a proof of concept I would love for you to make a 'Data Science from Scratch ' where you tackle a problem in the sports domain where you are an expert and there is a wealth of real world data to choose from Hey I am a graduate with Statistics as my subject I am about to complete a diploma in Data Science No technical background or job experience I want to dive deeper into Data Science What would you suggest me pick between getting a masters in Statistics or drop and focus on more Data Science learning for one year I am really confused with this decision Hi Ken Thank you so much I started learning data science years back but I lost the motivation Now after following your channel and watching the inspirational videos and great advice i feel confident to move forward i am seeking career transition into data science and you are motivating and helping me to stay on track After merging all of these concepts with my brain I'm going to fork your puns in my next video I think it's time for you to create patreon and youtube subscriptions i started with python that is really difficult actually i didnt have any data science knowledge then i started learning SQL alone evertjing was clear if u get basic idea u can do anything I think universitty of waterloo is best for getting a fang job in bay How many internships you did and have you did any co ops if yes then which is best Fliping practice is nice Thanks for showing this and now I will also try this because I also get confused between two things a tone of times We wanna see Ken starting a startup Let's give it a shot ken And hopefully I will become the vice president of it when it will become a larger company Haha Just kidding By the way your quality of videos is awsome keep it up You drove Uber on the weekends and just studied ML all week long Personally I would not do a data science master degree there is no consistency between programs if one were to do a stats or CS degree as you go to different schools much of the curriculum is very similar electives might be different I started going through the Kaggle courses The big picture makes sense but I always forget syntax and stuff One of the best series I've ever seen on youtube related to data science Thank you so much for this amazing effort Very inspiring and motivating Highly appreciated bro Haha very true about flipping the coin I was thinking about doing an extra degree in CS but it takes a lot of time and after I checked the syllabus many of the courses in the degree cover material I am not at all interested in and will not really be useful in the career I want k in debt wow I m in the UK on my second bachelors and no where near that I was wondering why not UI Chicago or IIT Chicago Btw great video as usual Short and simple just the right amount of everything Funny A big reason I chose the school I'm in now was also because I didn't want to take the GRE lol I loved the fact that you went to DePaul and started this channel I'm planning to apply for a masters in DS myself I've learned a lot about sports analytics on this channel and I'm hoping to start a channel myself one day Heyy I have seen in linkdin this daysofdata with Ken jee can you explain me what does that means Hi Ken what are your thoughts on Masters of Business Analytics program I m currently considering that over a Masters of Data Science due to it being more applicable to the corporate world Master Master Ken Hey Ken Is it possible to become a Data Scientist with a Bachelor in CIS and a Master Degree in Data Science or Business Analytics Thx Is the school required youtube video still on this channel D haha Robert Frost's The Road Not Taken comes to mind I'm mighty glad the decision you made seems to be working pretty fine You keep some of us going Ken Keep being awesome Hey Ken Love your videos they are extremely informative Currently I am on episode of your Data Science project from scratch series Can you please share your opinion on the below question it will be really helpful How is the Master's in Data Science program at Northeastern University Boston It's been hours and this video only has views strange Where i can get this version of the csv Tks in advance I was watching your videos to get more information about Data Science but i fell in love with you david blaine MIND FREAK Both fun and informative video Thank you Ken I think your commerce background IS important as it created one of the biggest filters in your decision making that is which school doesn t require a bachelor s degree in Computer Science I would think that the requirements in Data Science are lower is that correct Do you feel like the masters degree was worth it or could you have gotten where you are now without one If you come from a technical background is the MS worth the investment Quality video as usual Did you know anyone who did their MS in DS at DePaul I have a friend who is in that program and he said it's worth it but I was wondering if you knew anyone who did the program I'm really considering doing a Master's in DS since I'm graduating with a BS in Finance from a B level school and I feel like I'll need an MS to get a good job in the field I have bad ADHD and I'm not great at teaching myself things so I don't think the self taught route is for me Did you know anyone who did that program How was their post grad job placement Do you think the CS program was better Your editing skills have really improved since the start of your channel This was a really well done video I'd love to know more about how you do it since I'm considering starting a channel of my own You have an interesting story and it's cool to see how far this channel has progressed k is coming up See you in the next vid okay so I was going to insert a peace emoji there at the end of my comment but the menu bar on my macbook's keyboard doesn't seem to want to work today damn Thanks for watching everyone This is the video I mention about how to choose between a Masters Bootcamp or Certificate program https www youtube com watch v Q FjwzKFPuM ab channel KenJee Thank you for being a great mentor Master Master Ken your advice is constantly helping me alot Ken Jee We can't use Ridge regression in these kind of data because of sparse nature of dataset Right Brilliant Video Ken It was most enlightening that a lot of the decision pruning was purely practical ie no BCS requirement missed a deadline and didn't want to wait another year Good reminder that we don't live in a perfect world we live in this one Also on behalf of the entire community please accept our humblest apologies for our dire transgressions Master Master Kenneth Jee The hell is this person coding Skynet's Terminator OS Not a single Stackoverflow window in sight Can you also make video about data analyst roadmap and all Great video Ken Hi Ken Great decision making process That's how I am going to decide whether to go to grad school or industry Some nice nuggets in here Marketing yourself truth quality content can def help with getting a job Hi ken thank you for the video tutorial However my code works in reverse The 'keyword' search works at the end of the Scrapping Any help Hello Ken I have a question probably is a stupid one but I need an answer How and in which step we got eda data csv file I watched the videos but maybe I missed it Thank you so much for your help more videos like this please Hey loved your video Do you know any books that are related to soccer analytics Would love to get started with it Just getting started with this topic Keep up the good work you are my heroe year old going for a one year MS in Business analytics to break into the field and do a career change what say you Yay or nay i think we should make AI more powerfull and intelligent i am thinking about make a neural network who can code something itself and also learn from it if anyone is interested in my thinking please mail me on virat bhatt gmail com i want to do something out of the box but am a newbiei need to learn more things right now Hi Ken Thank you for the video Question I'm older and thanks to covid going to be learning from scratch as you said what should be the first language I start How can anyone think the courses on Kaggle is good I'll never know I tried them and was completely speechless They are so bad it's insane And the Instructors are technicians who are so over the hill I think that's why they're so bad I need someone who's a beginner like me not someone who's been working for years Hi Ken I'm newly transitioning into the data science field and am wondering how to approach building a data science resume if none of my work experience is in data science or tech I've listed several projects skills and certifications but should I also put work experience even if it's unrelated how would you recommend a beginner resume like this be structured My scrapper gets stuck when getting the data Any suggestions to resolve I have done algebra matrices algebric matrices functions and now im doing linear algebra Thank you very much Ha ha I laughed till death If i try somehow I will understand quantam physics But not git I just don't git it sorry why i got htmlsessiin object or request html module Video starts at hey Ken did you have to take additional math courses to get into your CS program if someone works a normal job and their CC has affordable online math courses would you recommend they take stats discrete linear and multivariable calc versus try to learn this stuff on their own Hi Ken Would you script your whole project in Spyder then if you wish to share it copy and paste it to Jupyter with markdown where necessary I'm just wondering why not skip the middle man and use Jupyter all the time Take care thanks for all the great info If some of you are getting the 'Accept Cookies' bar at the bottom then I suggest putting this code right before the while loop time sleep Auto accepts cookies try driver find element by css selector ' id onetrust accept btn handler ' click clicking to the X except NoSuchElementException pass time sleep Hi Ken this is so helpful but I do not get why does the constant appear on my co relation plot Hello Ken Thanks for your sound advice I have a quick question I am a snr manager with over years of experience Does it make sense for me to take up a Masters degree in AI and ML at this stage I am year old with an operations management background in BPO KPO call centers etc I have no programming language background although my maths was pretty strong back then What do you advise Thanks in advance hey ken while i am performing my wordcloud code part i am getting this error The imagingft C module is not installed what should i do This is some good stuff Ken I really like this series for doing this part Remove new lines from company text run this code df 'company txt' df company txt apply lambda x x replace ' n' '' replace ' r' '' Can u please explain how hourly was annual done like why we multiplied by I follow both of your content and I love it I have a biology undergrad and I have one more year for my masters in music performance I wanted to transition into data science SWE would you recommend the MCIT program Are there programs like that which made for non cs majors Extremely inspiring content Big brain jokes right there this video made everything really clear to me thank you Ken Solid video I am kind of binging your channel as I am committed to getting a job in Finance with Data Science You mentioned data wrangling being over of the workload at a job I am going hard on Pandas and all supporting libraries hours a day for a couple of months Do you think this will cover the data wrangling side or are there other libraries stacks tools that I should be getting into Thank you for all of the great content Lets say i am totally ignorant about this field and i start putting hours a days into learning How long till i get an internship or a job The Ken Jee Show This is interview has many great insights I'll be implementing some of these in the near future Good video Learn the source code for the algorithms and try to implement them from scratch Can you please make a short video on this Wow Great in depth video Thanks for explaining all of the pros and cons and what fits different personalities and backgrounds All the indian guys trying this project use the data directly present in the github repo dont run scrapper coz indian version of glassdoor is a bit differnt imo Data Dude Podcast Is Kaggle better for a Data Science portfolio Or is Github the way to go Thanks in advance I had no idea about Github pages and have ZERO desire to learn wordpress I was going to say F It and get a wix site Bahaha Now I'll have something more respectable for potential employers Thanks within the dataset there are some observations preappended with 'salary ' so int is throwing an error at this point of getting the min max salaries to get that out of the way i did this minus hr minus hr apply lambda x x split ' ' if 'salary' in x lower else x Thanks for your inspiring tips Thanks Thanks for this video Ken Can you please walk us through the Data domain Data Scientist Data Engineer Data Analyst recruitment process in one of ur videos I am doing my undergrad in Computer Sc Engineering The campus recruitment at my university is more Dev intensive focused on coding Data structures and Algorithms could you suggest me something Thanks Ciao Which data structures would you recommend knowing the ins and outs of for a data science interview as opposed to a software engineering interview So far I ve been focusing on arrays and recursion and eventually want to get into graph algorithms I'd start using kaggle from now on I always love your videos Great work Ken I'm from economic background if i want to enter in data science field what should i do how many years will take me to understand Am very happy to hear this news Thanks ken Let's win more GitHub desktop is friendly and easy for the beginners like me No need to memorize the command lines Tend to forget it if not used often I am an undergraduate math major student Could you please recommend some project ideas related to mathematics What data science bootcamps would you reccomend This was entertaining Btw I saw your name on the DS Go schedule tomorrow I'm so excited to hear from you there I'm that GA Data Science recent grad that's been stalking your channel lately D What would motivate you if you were a student who just started to learn data science I am in this position now and i cant find anything to motivate myself Thats a huge problem for some of us because the other problems like where can i learn data science has solutions everywhere Hope you'll answer Good content keep it up Awesome content as always thanks for making it simple and straight to the point It all makes sense now Oh by the way your video quality is top notch I just watched this on p K I think the reason why I would like to get into Data Science is just the outright versatility it can offer in many sectors such as finance healthcare IT etc The whole concept of breaking down and finding solutions is interesting I started to doing a Python course and I'm really enjoying the coding but I just wanted to ask I come from a Finance background with some banking experience Can you please give me some tips on what I should do exactly Thanks Thank you for the video Ken I am working on my own GitHub repository and I am at the moment working on Data Science projects thanks to your encouragement of daysofdata I shall be completing Data Analysis Machine Learning Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence in a few months and I will be sharing them on GitHub as well I wanted to thank you for your well tailored descriptive and concise yet enriching videos as they are of incredible help and I use them as a road map to becoming a Data Scientist With your guidance I hope I end up getting a great job in the USA or Canada and what I love more about is that you have been so interactive all along Thank you once again Ken Great info I wonder if we are also allowed to use these resources during an interview Please also explain Git Bash to people who use Windows Hi great video some tips for the reader from what I learned from work I recommend to start including git in every project you do I didn t do that but I wish i did It helps like ken said with version control and easier changes publishing instead of going online and going through a whole process and also ur gonna use it at work for sure so might as well practice He s using GitBash idk if it was mentioned and I missed it but that s the command line interface to use git It s also good cause it uses Bash so if u know Linux Ubuntu it s be easier to use I use the same but there are others if you don t want to start with a command line like VsCode Atom GitHub Desktop although I recommend Bash use Git Status pretty much after every command because If ur in ur own branch and want to switch to another one all your work will be lost if not committed or stashed first Git Stash is just what it sounds like temporarily stashed or saves your changes to the side so u can do other work and then Pop later Wow I love these series Very helpful and inspiring Hey Ken I just finished my graduate certificate and realised that I need to learn more to get a job I might continue on with the data science masters Just wondering What monitor are you rocking and if you were going to invest in a budget monitor what size should you get Cheers Jason Thanks for your help earlier So from what I hear self taught is not necessarily a bad thing in data analytics Hyperion a TITAN and bigger than super sub well deserved thanks Can we git jupyter notebook I just started learning DS and I only code from jupyter notebook any recommendation Nice video I have a question what os do you use in work environment like windows linux unix I GIT IT NOW Best explanation of git I ve ever watched Puns are one of my favorite hobbies second only to sarcasm I ve only used GitHub for quick reference It s good to know the benefits to documenting projects and learning how to use the platform locally Very helpful Side note The lighting and orangey color of your shirt is very flattering which helped me concentrate more during your delivery lol the wink Haha great video Ken Instead of replacing master with main git should just rebrand to got since Ken has just told its entire story great vid I watched the MIT Git intro lesson about a month ago and it definitely overcomplicated things I like how this sticks to what commands you are actually going to use Great to see you BRANCHing out with new types of content What do you mean awful puns I thought they were hilarious Its showing error page not found Thanks for watching everyone I hope you git it now Checkout these videos next Data Science Project From Scratch Series

seen this sooner definitely clears up so much Although now I realize I've never actually even worked on git locally and just do all my work projects on github is that okay or should I learn how to use Git locally Also digging the music I was looking for something like this Thanks Ken To kill a mockingbird Your pun game is stronger than ever Awesome video as usual very helpful Awesome video Ken as usual I really thought you would end saying git good learning Data Science P Awesome video love all the puns git gist and commit we git it now I m confused as to why analytics is so important in sports b c of the A s when the A s never actually won anything Where they successful yes But they never got a Championship so it ultimately didn t work Those puns had me rolling please stop lol Omg it is very helpful can you like make a tutorial for git hub the puns in the intro are a good measure of how familiar git is I learned in my workplace how useful git can be for worklflows I fully recommend it to everyone for projects First step in your data science journey is probably good puns Hi Ken amazing content never come across such a thorough video especially data scrapping part Big fan of playingnumbers com too Can you make a video of the same type for a data visualization project maybe using tableau Subscribed Your videos are great bro Do they do it for internships too Is there a difference between using df 'arg' and df arg I am equipped with Python Tableau MySQL Statistics Spacy NLTK Web Scraping with Scrappy Splash Selenium Web Driver Deploying with Flask Mobile App development with React Native Deep Learning with TensorFlow I may forgot some skills like VB Scripting etc My all experience is all hands on coding and with project samples I am IT person with experience and switched to Data Science I don't know who will hire me Any Guidlines or Suggestions I can join any offer immediately today I loved this series Thankyou for giving us the time to make this they're so helpful for people like us please make more ' do you think statistics as a major is a nice foundation while also learning python on the side Good motivation booster Since this down time I have started on the path of a new career in data I have completed cert scrum master cert of completion up running power bi desktop with maven analytics currently enrolled in sql I plan to take pyhon tableau next how do I find a mentor or data project to join to apply my new learning thanx Really fun interview to watch Thanks for sharing your background and tips that made you as successful as you are upvote for sports analytics projects Love it Hey ken I know it's a off topic for this video but I only know you an IT expert who can answer my questions I want to learn android development I am already a web developer But I am not sure if I need a computer science degree to become a android developer So can you tell me do I need a computer science degree in order to become a android developer or can become a self taught android developer So I did a project on linear regression and I'm still kind of struggling to understand it I looked up Kaggle Notebooks titled Linear Regression or something close to that Other than watch other courses read other books and do more projects is there anything else I can do Hey Ken have you ever tried Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp by Jose Portilla I'm learning so far from that How much time I should spend by week I m in a university doing statistics and I already work in the field but I feel like I should been looking for more kaggle datasets or more complex problems but or i look too simple datasets or too complicated There is a intermediate list of datasets This guy is amazing Glad that I listened since I was being overwhelmed with choosing PowerBI vs Tableau I'll probably stick with one have already started to know basic of it Hello Ken and all data scientists here I just started my Data science journey and currently I am going through Machine learning In ML course which I am enrolled they mostly use sklearn library to build models Is that a best approach or should I learn building model from scratch My chromedriver version is as per chrome browser so thats already uptodate what could be the reason for this error Great Thank you I ve been reading quite a few articles to try to figure out the relationship between these terms Thank you for putting in plain English How can we submit a resume for review This error is shown while I ran python py py I have renamed requests py bcoz of package

episode I have done computer engineering and have Btech degree then I did mba in sales now I have sales experience of years I want to change my field and utilise my btech degree in computer engineering but I don't have any experience can you help me guide of how to proceed into data science field and how to get experience Awesome I saw it coming haha D Thomas Edison says I have not failed I've just found ways that won't work Our greatest weakness lies in giving up The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time So to anyone who is reading this keep pressing on lambda loop statements Another great video Ken Thank you for the inspiration Do you use your skills for the other side of sports analytics On the bet side Great step This is glorious I have been researching computer programs for sports betting for a while now and I think this has helped Have you ever come across Meyackentae Foundational Magic just google it It is an awesome one of a kind product for discovering how to use this method to finally win at betting without the headache Ive heard some decent things about it and my work buddy got amazing results with it Deep data science That the best name It combines Deep learning and Data science together Greate series I stand by The Jee Spot If you re in th year of high school and i wanna go into data science what advice would you give like what subjects to take on etc How about a little double entendre Deep Learning with Ken Jee Also model s training Very helpful Thanks for giving such an in depth breakdown Can A Machine learning Engineer work remotely Breaking Through your content has really given people a direction as in how to break into the data industry but you also mentioned how you would also include other stuff like human optimization so I think the title Breaking Through would hand in hand with what you mentioned because there s usual always some barrier into something we want to get into whether it s a learning barrier or something else Can't wait Is an applied mathematics undergraduate a good path to data science The Podcast Channel https www youtube com channel UCpEJMMRoTIHJ vG q EwqCg sub confirmation The Podcast Clips Channel https www youtube com channel UCHt WWmcdUXAeiIc E Cw sub confirmation Thanks for tuning in everyone and I'm excited to share this new journey with you I'm months late But I will be here for your K stream soon how about A podcast of life and data or Life through data and data through life I am not sure that's all I got so far Good luck with the new podcast D Just be careful not to get too much on your plate I should know I am in the process of entirely rebuilding my life Data Science Conversations with Ken Jee Ken is this a plastic plant This might turn out to be my fav post Linear Digressions keep em coming Can you do a video or have you done one on saturation of junior data scientists in the job market Do you think the field is growing still and that demand will out over supply for labor in data science Go with DataScienceandSexwithKenJee CumSpunkCentral BallswithSmegma Already have commented many names in your channel Good luck with your new podcast project Hi ken I'm excited for the podcasts I realise this is off topic but I just wanted to hear your thoughts next year I will be doing a conversion course into data science and AI with a year in industry as I am doing a masters in Uni I had an undergrad in sports science so I relate to you So I have a year and a lot of spare time to prepare what do you recommend I learn ahead of time coding SQL Building a portfolio or what Thetechworker th here Very exciting news of the new podcast channel looking forward to it Hey Ken Have you seen the learning paths available from Microsoft for Azure like AI Edge and many others And also those available from Amazon for AWS I was wondering what's your opinion about those resources and whether it'd be useful to spend time with them Congrats Ken can't wait to check out your podcast Hello Ken I am a graduating Sports Management student I am interested in working in sports research Where do I start Let's help ken reach k What sports do you cover Made it to the last video of the series Yey thxs for all this I was getting anxious because I wasn't sure how to structure and use all the tools I'm getting from the courses videos books etc in an actual project and this was really helpful D Ken first of all thanks a lot for making the series I wanted to ask your opinion of a fresher me doing a project on the credit risk analysis from kaggle As tons of people have done a lot of work on this already do you think its worth working on it do you think it could be interesting enough to be put on the resume I love this series Please don't stop making these videos Get familiar with python R and basic statistics Focus on learning by doing Start on a basic project and explore other s code on GitHub Build algorithms from scratch Start to push the boundary Work on a advanced project and make the work public on GitHub Set good goals and stay accountable Can't wait to see your BJJ match I work as a data scientist already I wanted to know how to get clients on my own to work on data science products I feel that a lot of middle management don't convey the right idea about data science hence I want to see if I could start my own consultancy on getting projects I wanted to know how is it possible I m a senior in high school and am planning to major is data science in college Is this a bad idea Do jobs not want people with a data science major I hope you see this and respond Loosing Failures Doubt just have fun enjoy them It's not atom bomb to be honest i think it's really hard to apply data science to companies if you graduated with non it math physc and never took a course Because many company need a written evidence like certificate from us which states that we really have skill in data science I know we can study python sql or any program language with self taught in online platform but that's not enough to prove that we can do data science Thanks for bringing awareness to this You've been such an awesome mentor and educator We all have those moments imposter syndrome sucks Keep making awesome videos Ken I wouldn't sweat it I don't see it as you giving me advice which if I were in your position I would feel it overwhelming and with a lot of responsibility The way I see it it is that by you sharing your life experiences and other people experiences when you do the interviews your are providing me with invaluable information I think it is MY responsibility to take the information that you provide as an advice or just as interesting information I appreciate all the effort that you put into researching the topic and putting it in an understandable manner By the way I got the point of your video that is embraced it and grow with it Thanks for your channel Hi ken I am struggling to find an affordable desktop computer or laptop No more than USD that would help me open and use IDEs and other tools fast and comfortably I would really appreciate it if you could give me your recommendations as my laptop is really slow Thank you The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts while the stupid ones are full of confidence Charles Bukowski I have never seen so long meaningful comments in any YouTube video ever Seriously Ken Jee you are showing the power of truth and doubt Great video as usual smashed it and its not only applicable for data science I think alot of what you said applies in life If the smartest man in the world Socrates said I know that I know nothing what makes anyone think they know everything Bloody well done mate That's really helpful You are the lamb bearer in a really Dark tunnel It is upto people to follow your advice or not People like me who follow your advice really admire you bro i wanna give you a hug What is the best tool for webscraping got stuck around when trying to print the career stats it keeps telling me that AttributeError module 'nba api stats endpoints playergamelog' has no attribute 'playergamelog' any thoughts Had to hit that sub Thanks for being the one stop shop for data science and sports analytics on YouTube Keep it up This was a cool video Thanks I am very new to coding in python and data science in general but i keep getting a module not found error Specifically no module named 'nba api' I downloaded the nba api in my CMD and it successfully installed but i keep getting same error Thoughts Man mad respect for opening up on this subject Cheers from Bolivia I discovered your channel a few hours ago and I've been binge watching a lot of them I wish I can give this video a double thumbs up when I saw that bag of golden island jerky in the background Very power message thanks I needed that Thanks for sharing and appreciate all that you do for us i am learning data science RIGHT NOW so this is interesting Python and stats and machine learning and TINY POTTED PLANTS YES I wanted to ask you what framework or editor will be the best to learn Python I want to start learning this language but I wasn't sure how to do so I saw some videos using Sublime Text and Django but as a beginner I will like to have this big small advise I'm interested in Data science and I'm transferring from BS in architecture technology to applied mathematics Is it better to join a bootcamp like Flation school or spend does years studying applied mathematics I would not mind getting a low position in data science or data analyst role This is some grade A motivation for those that doubt theme selves I m going into tech and I doubt myself all the time As you said it can be useful to allow that to drive myself Thanks for the video Ken this was important This is so helpful Thank you Ken D We fail more then we success so Data Science is like real Science In Academia you only have high success to failure rate at low levels Once you get to new and complex things it can get hard Really hard And depressing Of course you can always be that lucky one and get your experiment parameters right in first go I used to be what a lot of people would think of as a real scientist the one that does experiments in a lab coat in a lab to discover and create new things A lot of things in Academia is presented as if the success was effortless nobody is showing the amount of work that went into it results from failed experiments rarely get published if at all One of my friends also has imposter syndrome I have different issues I am always hungry for knowledge and new things and I love solving problems also I'm unemployed atm so I can't have an imposter syndrome As for failures this is a normal part of the process I don't remember who said it but it went like this when you enter the a new uncharted territory when you try new things nobody did before everybody is underqualified for the job I think this is a huge part of what being a Scientist is you try to do new things and you fail and you learn from it and you try again Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't Some problems can't get solved at this stage maybe new tools theories new data need to appear first Sometimes it is too expensive to do what is needed to get a good solution maybe an approximation can be good enough I'd like to say that this is why you get paid the big bucks because it requires certain way of thinking intelligence and skills to solve problems To be a Scientist it ain't an easy job in general Sadly a lot of Scientists are really poorly payed And a lot of research is conducted in a very bad unproductive way but that's an off topic The job hunt IMO it is a bit of lottery And just because someone has amazing credentials doesn't necessarily mean they are amazing themselves I've worked with people that had PhDs from an university ranked in world's top one of these people came even from a VERY VERY good research group and they were not living up to the standard I imagined The best Scientists I worked with came from UK university outside the country's top and India Of course good credentials do help you to get a job That's why you should get them But also get the understanding of the things you are doing and the knowledge of the subject A PhD diploma is a proof a person wrote and defended a PhD it does not make someone a good Scientist Maybe it should but these are two different things I also heard words of wisdom that went like these don't compare yourself to other people you don't know their full story Compare the you of yesterday to the you of today I'm off with that this comment is getting too long Good video Ken Thank you so much for this video It resonated so much with me I usually get these waves of insecurity aka imposter syndrome although it's always lurking in shadows I have learned to just keep going and try to be honest about what I know and do not know I have been told that I should be more confident though Ken been acting kind of sus I think he vented haha great video as always Data science is worse or best field I am just a beginner in this field still trying to adapt data science and ML and whenever I see my friends around me who are also doing the same thing but almost most of them had already started months prior to me and they're doing so good I doubt that if I will ever be able to learn all these concepts I'm always doubting of my skills lol Thank you Ken this type of videos honest talk really helps Bests letterly this is what I feel almost in every competitive environment I engage in Some times I have objective evidence that I am worse than most people like in sport when no one picks me to play in their team And sometimes in the contrary I think I'm bad but when I see other people's performance I know that I'm not I think that is because we fail to something called survivorship bias Most of the people that we see are successful since successful people have more popularity so the sample of people that we are comparing ourselves with is not random Me Wow I am seriously unqualified for this position better apply Okay but in all seriousness thank you for your honesty on this one I think you spoke to what a lot of us are feeling it's great to know none of us are ever alone on this also can we or can we not get a DaysofData Among Us game night one of these days As a beginner I've had this feeling for the past months when I look at job offers there is always one or two or plenty of things that I'm not familliar with at all but you have made it easier for me to improve myself each day through your videos and tutorials and hopefully I will land an internship in the next months After years experience I have a strategy for dealing with imposter syndrome Keep a reading to learn list with techniques frameworks or anything data science related As soon as you feel a spell of imposter syndrome coming learn something asap and don't stop learning until you feel better again One thing I neglected to mention is that part of impostor syndrome is that you feel like you're going to get found out Luckily people usually a lot more wrapped up in their own insecurities than they are in exposing yours Thanks for watching everyone Videos and Articles Mentioned Dunning Kruger https www businessinsider com imposter syndrome makes the best employees feel like a fraud heres how to embrace it text It might help to understand to realise they're dumb My interview with richard https www youtube com watch v hJetp LMrw ab channel RichardOnData Jeff's article about landing data science jobs http www jefflichronicles com blog i got job offers during the worst job market in history heres the data Richard's Impostor syndrome Video https www youtube com watch v jw w cdxk t s ab channel RichardOnData Try watching this next https www youtube com watch v jf j lWmFPU ab channel KenJee Thanks for opening up actually after seeing this video i felt so much better it's like you express the doubts inside my head all this time and honestly i believe you are doing a good job at least there are a lot of things i ve learned through your videos Great video and topic Ken I think everyone feels this to an extent Super important to be humble and modest although confidence is key too I really liked how he talked about learning to like this feeling I think a physical training metaphor here is really apt When you work out it hurts and is uncomfortable as you train muscles you may not be using very often One thing many people who work out regularly talk about is how good they feel afterwards even though their body is in pain Similarly whenever you learn something it hurts almost phyically You can feel your mind straining to try and understand whatever abstract concept your reading about For some reason we are surpised by this Shouldn't this be easier How does anyone understand this or The guy in the video I watch made it seem like this was easy to understand of course we do not see how long they had to sturggle to actually understand the concept If we go in with the expectiation this going to hurt but I love that feeling of brain ache after a good reading I think it can help with those feelings a lot The other issue is time the feeling that you need to become competent in a short ammount of time sucks I don't know what to do about that we are finite creatures after all I feel like in the technology field Impostor Syndrome has just become a consistent feeling a lot of people develop I remember doing my Bachelor's for CS and constantly feeling inadequate or inferior by comparison to my peers cause I felt like my coding abilities in comparison to theirs were terrible That got heightened when it came to applying for jobs and getting rejections all throughout college Ironically the one thing that kind of got me out of my own head when it came to that feeling was Data Science I found a genuine passion for wanting to do it and that kind of helped me subvert the Imposter Syndrome I felt from coding at least Now I'm in my first semester of going after my Data Science Masters and I still feel that Impostor Syndrome looking at how qualified my peers are by comparison and questioning my own abilities yet again but also having gone through it the first time around I realize a lot of that is just me being in my own head similar to how you've embraced it over the years Thanks for posting about this Ken You DataLeap and the Data Professor have become my go to channels to watch ever since I started my Data Science journey months ago and hearing that you feel that level of doubt in your own life even with how much of a great figure you are in the Data Science community is honestly kind of relieving to know This approach to the imposter syndrome is really needed and might be a truly helpful for many Thank you for this Ken Jee I m new to the field I feel like I know absolutely nothing but I m going into a master of Data Science because I truly want to do AI ML work I don t have a traditional CS background so this is all scary When did everyone get comfortable with the AI ML coding interview and overall interview process I'm glad that you don't use background music anymore Hey Ken I think this video is important because for the last decade or more life has been shown through rose tinted glasses and instagram filters Being real with people is exactly what I people need I think especially in this bogus job market Thanks Have a good weekend while imposter syndrome is self focused it is inherently comparative trust yourself and what YOU bring to the table everyone is on a journey here and NO ONE knows it all Honestly I started being more organized in the field of Data Science when I started following your contents and your supports I still remember myself few months back when I don't know how to write a good resume and how to organize my GitHub projects and LinkedIn profile Without your regular updates and supports I would never be here no doubt Personally I am so thankful for your support and you have done great things for us Ken Keep up the good work Your content is very helpful Impostor syndrome is real and I am finding lot of people are talking about it via YouTube Thanks for creating suggestions on how to overcome the insecurities I need to learn programming first then I can give it a shot Thanks fo the video impostor Nice video titile On the current wave Thanks for opening up and talking about this Ken Just know you re helping many Data Science newbies like myself learn and love the field Keep it up Your Content is Exactly what I need in my life the syndrome got worse after i started playing among us yes Sounds like some among us theory You probably have the reading process down but check out Speechify https m youtube com watch v Hx H jmYPw Hi Love to watch your content and am really interested in having a career in football analytics or cricket analytics I am learning data analytics through online courses and planning to get an internship in sports analytics firm Is that fine or do I need to look for a degree in sports Video starts at Thank me later Hi ken loved the content you have been putting out regarding DS I have some doubts regarding my situation since its quite specific and I wanted to get your opinion I was going to start my undergrad as an Engineer in Data and Mathematics but I have decided to wait one more year so that I can study in Germany I live in Mexico so returning here with with a German title will allow me to secure a job with ease In the mean time I have been considering possibly switching majors to something like Economics or Physics I have thought of becoming a DS for two years now however I am worried that the Job opportunities DS promises might shrink and that my degree might limit me the amount of jobs I can find in comparison to the other degrees I am interested in I am not the best at coding however I have been told that as long as I know how to properly query with SQL which I can and have a good exposition of my data I should be fine Although I know I would enjoy my time studying something like Economics I feel like it would be really easy for me and I would only want to get in degree in something I struggle with so that I have a more complete profile when I enter the corporate world TLDR I really enjoy the implications of being a DS and want a challenging major but I don't know if Im cut out to be one and might consider just doing a Masters after an undegrad in something else cant import glassdoor scraper as gs anyone knows why I've seen a promotion link from you for subscription but I kinda lost it and can't remember where I found it Could you send me a link please I agree with the passion argument When someone is passionate about their work they will find a way to improve even if it may be difficult Ken really nailing it with the accessories here D The last point really made me smile because my largest ML project yet also utilizes embedded devices so that was a good amount of positive reinforcement Haha it was really interesting to take a look at Tina's resume D With this series one always finds optimization potential in one's resume Great content Ken would you recommend AWS Machine Learning awesome interview Thanks ken for sharing another great and interesting interview This video made me more aware of the importance of building my personal brand My weekly sharing at maimai local social medium like linkedin in China has lasted months I did not realized it has been so long until today Just keep it as a habit I've worked in the manufacturing industry for over years I strongly believe that AI and big data analysis will bring our industry to a brighter future Though I'm still struggling in picking up the data science skills I hope to bring awareness of AI power to more people from the manufacturing industry That's why I started my sharing of AI big data analysis the driven power behind IT industry G block chain The highest number of views are still far away from those popular posts which got thousands of views I'm not discouraged because I know what I'm doing and why I'm doing it So I will keep making my efforts Oh men I don't know why I just saw this Nonetheless I've been going through the Kaggle Microcourses for a few days now Thanks for the recommendation Day Late Next project build a web app that smashes the like button It's great interview Ken Thanks for sharing with us

great interview from thee ken jee Nice Thanks Ken for another great video great insights into data analytics from John David Just what I needed Thanks for having me on Ken I really enjoyed this conversation Rd place on the replies list sorry this was useless typo in the thumbnail Ken Waiting for this kind of video for a while now Thank you Ken Hello I wanted to ask that I want data related to job profile Data Scientist and Job location as Bangalore When I searched in glassdoor com the salary for the jobs posted in bangalore is not specified so any help here would be appreciated want to develop a fashion designing bot i e a software that can generate new apparels on giving instructions by a non programmer designer eg colour combo age gender season etc So which language should I choose R or Python I'm nearly and have just recently decided to become a data scientist Is there any hope for someone that was never good abysmal at mathematics to get into this field I was thinking of taking data science because it involved coding But now I'm not so sure about it Hey Ken Thanks for another great video I have a question about projects on resumes I am struggling to think of ways to quantify the purpose of projects beyond just the results of different machine learning models Because the results are not really put to use after finding them there is no real quantitative impact to put on the resume such as a increase in sales Is it necessary or suggested to have this for your projects If so what ways might you go about restructuring expanding upon data science projects to address their possible lack of usability in case u r intrested from twitterscraper import query tweets import datatime as dt import pandas as pd begin data dt date end date dt date limit lang

choose algorithm for machine learning Hey Ken I am an under degree graduate If I learn data science through online will company hire me If yes then which is best online platform for beginners Would you recommend doing a university course in this type of area or doing something like a physics degree and then trying to get into sports analytics Hey Ken Another video idea for the pile a video on the maths you need to do data science and the best places to learn it I've been slowing working my way through the Mathematics for Machine Learning textbook and it's hard work for someone who never did maths outside of high school These keep getting more fun Im also so glad that people are finding them helpful Hello I don't know if you remember the other day when I asked about the automated tennis video analysis I have been doing some research and I found some research papers and even a thesis with that system I am trying to do Is it illegal to apply it using OpenCV or some library Can I use a bit or do I have to do everything from scratch What is are it's difference with Sports Statistics Hey Ken I have an option of staying at a medium size school and continuing as a business major or going to UT Austin and doing Liberal Arts Which do you think is better for a Data Science career Where do you learn stat for DS most effieciently Thinkstat datascience Learnt a lot wow Hey Ken I m really enjoying this series I just have a quick question If I was crunched on space in fitting all the projects I ve done would you say it s better to keep your most recent projects on your resume OR would you rather advise to keep the projects that are relevant to the position company you are applying to although it s been years since you ve worked on that specific project Thanks for another great resume review It gave me a lot of ideas of how I can improve my own resume hey ken should we describe the personal projects we did in the resume or just mentioning them with an understandable name is enough thanks great helpful video can I also send you my resume for review on the next video Ken I'm a huge fan of your channel I think you're providing an incredible service to aspiring data scientists The insight you provide is so valuable even in careers beyond data science I'm doing my PhD in Chemistry but I've really taken an interest in data science over the past few months Right now I've been applying machine learning to help develop low cost COVID diagnostic platforms in our laboratory I still have a lot to learn but who knows maybe one day you'll be reviewing my resume Now every algorithms works in order to show what we want to watch say YouTube Google Ads etc So sir my question is doesn't it makes us less interested in exploring new things What if algorithms only shows content based on our past results and never lets us know new things Suppose i don't have any idea what is deep learning and even didn't hear it before So how it is likely that one will get to know about it just by recommendation system or any other search result Sorry it might sounds weird Thanks for watching everyone Make sure to check out Tina's Channel https www youtube com channel UC UXDak

Ken and Tina K is getting closer and closer You guys should take the WORKERA exam by deeplearning ai to see how your skills compare to each other and us in Data Science and Machine Learning Would be a fun video It was certainly fun watching this resume review Beepbeepboop St What s your take on references in Resume s Also for someone who never went for a job but straight for post graduation how do you deal with not having that experience up there Sir how can stylish resume frame do u have any idea where I can get free resume frame please tell me I am first viewer On point suggestions Hi Ken why don't you use R Studio as your IDE It does support Python Great video a big thanks on the tips just got a question I am currently taking a machine learning course but I am using matlab can matlab be a substitute for python in this case and further on in data science how essential is python comparing to matlab Cheers thanks for the recommendations I am a sas user instead of Python or R although i just started to learn Python any suggestions Thanks for the video super helpful and love the sport examples Thank you Ken for creating this video Simple rules and defining what these rules are a great way to start I am also starting my data science journey and found this motivating and helpful Hi Ken First off thanks for all the quality content you put out I have a question after watching this and your boot camp vs certificate video I've got a physics work background with no degree I'm looking to go back to school for a masters in physics in mind but interested in combined joint degree options I'm leaning towards mathematics but with the priority of CS towards Data Science I might consider the later Would a bootcamp be enough as long as I do my own projects and networking to keep DS an option or would you strongly recommend the Phys CS joint degree over the combined phys math masters bootcamp option I already have some programming history with a technology diploma and wouldn't mind the bootcamp Thanks Is there an API for NCAA basketball stats Is the get teams function pre written I'm confused as to where that comes from Also love your vids Agreed there is no replacement for real world projects When tutorials are designed they will always come to a successful model with good results and will usually have the data nicely prepared for you That's exactly opposite of the real world You may work on a project for weeks and conclude there is no signal in the data at least in its current form or you may work weeks on just preparing data or learning enough domain knowledge to understand the data That said tutorials and class learning are great to learn the workflow and structure of analysis As you said you will be constantly going back and forth between direct coding and learning new methods to tackle new problems I would say if you have an idea of the domain you will be working in you should focus your efforts on the models and concepts relevant to that domain There isn't a whole lot of similarity between analyzing mass scientific tabular data and computer vision Wonderful presentation Thanks very much for all the info Hey Ken I also want to learn data science but i am confuse form where i start to learn data science Can you provide me Step that i can follow to be a data scientist The master branche of Github pages doesn't appear on sources what have I done wrong Or you can collect your personal life data aka self tracking and then analyze it like I do www measuredme com Thanks Ken you are the best I manage to get my hands dirty but I am curious about starting up my own scraping using another problem can I still make use of the same function Hi Ken I need help here When to choose a source the master branche didn't appear on my choices only the main appeared And so my website's link gave error Is there anywhere I cld have mistaken when the process I need help here Hi Ken jee Could I get my resume reviewed I have made changes to my resume after watching your video I bet you'd love to see the changes also would like to get more suggestions on the current one Hi Ken Great video and value I learned alot I have one question Why did you make a separate column for Employer provided salary It makes sense to me to simply remove it from text and treat it as regular salary What is your opinion on this I just subscribed and the number turned Nice Job kens dad must be visiting the only reason for the bucket of fruit Hi Ken thanks for the video I'm years old and I recently chose to land a sport analytics job I'm really interested in soccer and basketball Is there a related job or activity that I can do at this age Would like to hear your thoughts on this https www careercup com resume Fucking legend Ken got that Under Armor sponsorship Best video ever I feel so much better about learning to become a data scientist And now I have a great resource I can use for my own code Ken is awesome daysofdata Great approach for working on a good project Thanks for sharing I'll get my hands on it when I master my basics I think Ken Jee youtube is on fire I start watching when the subscriber is below than k and now almost hit k Keep updating KJ and I am waiting for the end to end project using Docker or Kubernetes Hi Ken I am a international student studying masters in information systems in US I wanted to know if companies look for machine

I laughed so FREAKINNG hard when he said we extract signal from the noise Great video as usual Ken Thanks for the video Try interviewing these amazing people Kiril iremnko Jose Portilla Jon Kron DJ Patil I was really expecting you to eat all the papayas Durians instead of mangos looks like someone has been enjoying the sun haha Great video You should have mentioned RShiny Shiny apps in your second third bullet point though But I'm heavily partial biased towards R haha Great vid I like the idea of doing a project involving web scraping The one thing that can be frustrating about being in grad school for stats is all of our data sets are already cleaned for us We just get it and most of the time it's all good to go so we can just worry about doing whatever statistics we need to do on it Scraping data sounds like a good way to get some nice raw data that would require some cleaning and then running some cool analytics on after some EDA Great content Pivoting my career interests to data science has recently sparked an idea for a startup I might want to pursue one day in the near future Hello ken need a video on ' How a real life data science project looks like how they gather data how they process it etc ' what are the tools used by industry A glimpse of a real world data science project is required to attain the necessary skills Guess who just recovered from Covid Great content I really like these ideas This video motivates me to learn more and be creative First time scraping data I did not took into account the effect that would have on the site requested over k urls without any pause between the requests Two days later i went to the site to manual check some data and they had severely restricted my IP I could request a url every minutes or so Now That's What I Call Unusual Projects Volume Thanks for watching everyone Try watching these videos next days of data https www youtube com watch v uXLnbdHMf w ab channel KenJee Essential projects for your

the help of your videos thank you so much Love the papayas Excellent insights honestly if you are good at visualization and linear models that covers most part Thankyou for such informative content Ken Jee I would highly appreciate it if you can review my resume since i am also aspiring to be a Data Scientist in the future Why clocks behind you And Saved to playlist Thanks Ken Thankyou for sharing your knowledge with us Solid video and the papaya's look amazing Thanks for the info Ken good vid im not sure but you insert alpa when in the lasso regression not sure if its an mistake Will you consider making a video about putting together a project portfolio website It would be really helpful Very intriguing When you got to the golfing section it gives me hope that once I get my master's in data science I will actually be able to combine data science with exercise science My master's in exercise science may not be so useless after all Hey Ken your down to basics and straightforward approach to the explaining data science and learning it are very confidence inspiring to someone trying to get into the field I have a background somewhat in statistics in that I graduated with an undergrad in psychology but with a focus on statistics I did quantitative and qualitative study in undergrad and I think I have some chance of using that to my advantage I'm working currently to pay the bills and keep needs like health insurance available and I'm currently starting the self study method I've binged through a few videos and I'm going to try ultralearning data science but I'm really not sure where to go from there I'm going to try to build a good portfolio but I feel like if I just try to say I have a degree in psych buut it's with a focus on psych stats and then get just a cert or a bootcamp then it won't be worth it for anybody looking to hire Getting a masters is always on the table but like you said that's a big time and money commitment for no guarantee of a career out of the gate In the end I think the connections of a bootcamp are more beneficial for me but I also don't want to shell out cash to find out that method would not make me look as good on a resume compared to a degree program Do you think a psych degree is a handicap or something I can still leverage I have enrolled for this course and I am currently undergoing the rigors of it It would be great if you could check out the curriculum and let me know if this would be helpful and whether it is at par with industry standards To be honest this Masters program just scratches

Understanding the equations of the graph to begin with maybe Although I know a lot of statistical packages do most of the stuff for you but I believe understanding the underlying algorithm or the derivation of the equations would be helpful further down the line as I progress With plethora of resources I simply don't know where to get started and where to stop I understand the python codes that someone else may have written but I am yet to reach a stage where I can start building something from scratch and that is something I really need to push myself to achieve as quickly as I can Any help to get me closer to this is much appreciated The model's training is the new The program's compiling Came here Today I know I am late for days of it but not to worry today is DAY Liked Subbed too also Joined the Discord it will be fun Sir Ken Jee Hi Ken Project from scratch series really helps me to understand how does data scientists works on real world project in their companies Thank you so much for your efforts very appreciating looking for more such kind of projects from you Hi Ken I hope you see this message I studied Information and Communication Science here in my Country Nigeria and I want to start a career in Data Science Apart from udemy udacity and the likes can you recommend where I can learn the basics and depth of Data Science Thanks You know what I hate about modern day sports analytics You got all these terms that never existed like or so years ago in sports with strange names that are hard to figure out what they even mean Yet people continuously write articles referencing them as if the average sports fan already knows what all these are and they're self explanatory even though they clearly aren't and it's fancy jargon that you have no clue what it could possibly mean Like I was reading an article talking about Breonna Stewarts win shares in her WNBA career Nowhere in the article did it explain what win shares mean Obviously it has to do with wins But beyond that I have no clue Then there is this other one that has defense or defensive in the title I can remember the full name of the stat but it's a really strange name It's mentioned all the time as if it's common sense to what it means and we should already know Lol Nobody ever explains these things as if they're normal stats Lol Hey Ken newbie here but loving the series and would love to see more Wondering what 'level' of data science this is Is this quite similar to what a data scientist would actually be doing in a work environment Is Alexander picking his nose in his profile picture lol Man I can't take programmers who use Windows seriously P Oh wow thanks too much for this video it makes me loving more data science My Gol actually is in one year being able to work as a data scientist with python I'm an financial auditor but python has been always a program that interest me too much specially the data science part So please i'm open to learn and improve my self and the most have fun in this environment of learning Again thanks you very much Hey Ken I am in the process of changing my major from a B S in Speech Language Pathology SLP to Data Science as the ROI Return on Investment is sub par in SLP and I have discovered many interesting facets associated with Data Science I have to take some prereqs before I can apply to my university's B S in Data Science program However I became concerned as you mentioned that Data Science COULD become oversaturated even if I have a Master's degree SLP is too since they'll take anyone ranging from pre med to Underwater Basket Weaving Will I keep a high paying job if I make this transition now and have a few years of experience after earning a grad degree or should I do the following B S in Data Science with Actuarial Science Minor B A or B S in Stats with a Minor in Computer Science Pick something in tech business econ finance or another field After learning from the recent pandemic and reevaluating my college career I have surmised that I want to do a tech math computer business or finance econ based job from home I was misled many of my classmates as well by those in SLP and believed I could do work from home but just like many majors they use work from home as a marketing strategy and omit info that there are many strings attached to this premise I m a physician assistant with a BS and MS in Heston sciences I have a lot of math in my background and some coding though and can get into a masters I work for a giant lab right now and think I can manage to get some collaborations if I go into this to practice I saw the Georgia Tech MS in analytics and it would fit perfectly However I do want to be employable and not just literate would this be a good idea I can afford it I work full time so it works for me and taking courses a semester would work for me because I really want structure Who else scroll through the video to find the path shown in the thumbnail like me Is knowledge of sorting algorithms useful DUDE THATS SO TRUE Everytime my model is training i check the phone for messages or memes and it is aways when someone passes by and sees me giggling and looking at the phone I feel embarassed Just awesome content i am fresh grad from BIS and i am going for data science few people in Egypt know the concept as it's the hot trend the next years This is so good to hear I'm trying to learn data science skills these days and for the past couple of days I've been feeling low But ill be back on track soon Thanks for the video Ken Its pretty motivational Hi Thanks for this very informative video Got a question Would appreciate if you can help me out I'm doing petroleum engineering currently Junior year I'm starting to get interested in data analysis and data visualization to be more specific What would you recommend I haven't learnt any programming languages yet but I'm decent with excel I've noticed a book about bets on your desk Do you use your data science knowledge for betting Who calls it BIG DATA anymore BEST Hi Ken I'm currently into data engineering with years of experience in big data analytics wanna move to data science which one will be good for me Here I have courses in my mind based on content can you suggest which one is better https www appliedaicourse com course Applied Machine learning course https www edvancer in course data science specialization Thanks in advance There is a degree on the college that i applied to that has data science as an undergraduate degree its pretty cool but it goes more through the math and statistics path Hi Ken tell me what you think of my idea Given my age and current educational background and the fact that we are in a pandemic and many companies are probably mitigating risks in regards to hiring trying to find myself an entry level data analyst job will probably be next to impossible I have decided that I am going to be starting a master's program this fall I am deciding on Colorado State University Global's AI and Machine Learning master's degree or going with Eastern University's Master's in Data Science Eastern's program is brand new so it probably does not have many reviews yet It seem like it is a program for all ability levels so I'm not sure of the robustness of the program I am thinking of going for a double master's in this field I could go the PhD route if I'm going to have a master's already by the end of next year but I do not feel like setting myself back several tens of thousands of dollars more in debt for doctorate school I figure the job market is not going to get any where near normal until at least With so many people out of work and looking for new jobs I feel it is going to get super competitive With the rock bottom tuition for some of these programs helping to minimize student loan debt I might as well use this time to rack up a master's degree or two in this field Nice video Ken thanks for explaining it so well easy to get frustrated with learning So I don't need to be a data scientist to get a job in data science In the process of learing python data analysis looks to be a good area to get work in where i live am i on the right track Now I am learning about data science field to begin my new career path This video helps me a lot to guide my way into this field I m currently learning from course and also am looking at other resources for further learning I would like to say thank you and keep it up on your work That means to me a lot Bazara net Very good advice Top Sites for your career Linkedin Indeed Naukri

You still code sitting down Funny even for non data scientists this speech is explanatory meaningful and consistent good video what is a dog fish api I know the jokes a reference but I still dont get it Can someone help me out i'm getting a straight horizontal line when i plot Lasso regression any idea why that's happening This is the good one Ken Jee and btw my model is still in training Hi sir what can you recommend and prefer I'm planning on taking Masters in Information Technology with especialized in Data Analytics or should I go for Masters in Business Analytics I'm currently working as Software testing engineer both Manual and Automation Thanks for your feedback the above code gives me blank or square bracket result Latexkhkhkh lol How about you guys do on what interviewers say to junior Data scientists Do u know know numpy scipy random forest neural networks Can you do this task for us for free cos we can't figure out how to do it but we wont get back to you after the rd round or reply oh sorry we need someone with years experience for the entry level position but damn you can code I will just clone all your projects there are a lot of useful staff here oh by the way we gave the job to this dude he is really good at using Excel Ken what does the parameter initialization of weight mean can you explain hahaha this haha this is what I want to tell recruiters every time watching this video while I'm running my model lol Forgot 'I give meaning to data' This was my watch for day number of my DaysOfData Nah jk but I'm sure I learned something lmao Now you HAVE TO make a Model's training T shirt Hey Ken I don't know if you remember me freshman well now a sophomore tho economics student in Turkey I just got an internship and learned python besides R and keep working I've recently been failing so many software engineering internship interviews To be honest I'm sick and tired of how hard SWE is With all of it's Data structures algorithms and it's challenges on leetcode it gets really stressful I took a udemy course on data structure and brushed up my coding skills for Java but I still struggled I've been looking into other fields such as Maching learning Cybersecurity and Data science what do ya'll think I should do I bet that will make more sense after I get some work experience on that point how to prepare for a data science intervju I watched this video while my model was training HAHAH the model's always training tbh from api to ipa we all grew up Fake not arrogant enough I'm not a data scientist but next time my wife looks at me sideways for spending too much time doing nothing my response will most definitely be Yea the model's training Hi Ken I hope you are doing well I have to muster up a lot of courage to write this knowing the reality could be bitter I work in a large tech firm I have CS degree from a reputed university I joined this firm as Oracle DBA hoping I will get a chance to transition to developer role at some point As this was my first job I asked the manager and HR's to help me with this transition but because I turned out to be a very good DBA they simply didn't allow me to move to other roles that were available inside organization I have already spent years in this role and have received promotions so I am more or less viewed as a Senior DBA and I absolutely hate to call myself DBA My earnings are very good but I have job satisfaction I have stronger than average python skills I hold multiple AWS certs and have also worked in UI frameworks such as Angular Now I really don't wanna join another firm as a Senior DBA therefore I applied several entry level jobs for which I received no calls which is what I was expecting to be honest I am in a phase where I feel as what if I finish learning Data Science will it be worth it or am I making a wrong decision Have you ever seen anyone transitioning from DBA role to Data Scientist So basically what I am most anxious about is once all is said and done will I ever be hired in Data Scientist role I am really passionate about pursuing Data Science but afraid if all my efforts go in vain Also throughout these five years I haven't spent a day not coding it was very difficult as DBA's usually work round the clock I am painfully introvert which makes me even more sad that I can't advertise my skills have no friends even though I have fantastic communication skills I have to attend regular meetings with the client and give presentations I don't face any issues in business meetings but when it comes to showcase my interpersonal skills I absolutely suck I hope if you read this you wont get annoyed I couldn't tell the mess I am in right now to anyone I just want some guidance from you about my situation Best Regards Michael You should do this more You guys killed this Now I wanna become a data scientist just to say The model's training Really funny Adding humor is always great Model's training This is actually so much like machine learning algorithms themselves Like we go through loads of notebooks to understand the innate algorithms and patterns of being s good data scientist and then after we're done training ourselves with others notebooks we can test our understanding by predicting on newer projects and then matching with others who have done the similar projects Thanks for watching everyone I love making educational videos but sometimes it is nice to make one just for fun Enjoy Part https www youtube com watch v ogodLg UOYY ab channel DataLeap https www youtube com channel UC emuGbNM

sports analyst YouTuber an almost career counsellor And now he's making vines That are actually funny Is there anything he can't do stoppppp lmao the dogfish head API took me out Haha that's hilarious guys Wait no one calls it big data anymore Ha this is great I'm still in grad school for stats but hoping to one day get a data science job Though maybe I'll do stat consulting first then go into it Idk Love your channel though man It's made me want to start one of my own Biased data is provided in this video Hilarious Great job guys I'm watching this while the Model's training what do you mean i can't use a Jupyter notebook for this as a beginner i feel attacked in so many ways lmaoo Dogfish Head API hahaha And i thought it just me with small handy white boards on my table I just know people are gonna put Model's Training on tshirts now always the best tips thx man I ll start getting my news from your selenium beautiful soup data scrapper vector on raspberry lofi Windows XD Have you even heard of LaTeXxxXx Can confirm that model training is the BEST time to mess around doing something else I actually prefer to sit on the floor i found it really GROUNDS my thoughts so lame but laughed hard hahahahahahahaha Imma vomit on this excel sheet real quick Ngl Can relate with the excel workbook comment Selenium beautiful soup web crawler vector scraper that runs on ky raspberry pi lo fi g force windows Lol Bye got to go Model is training Ahaha Model's training is gonna be my go to procrastinating excuse Does anyone know if Ken has announced the winners of his nvidia conference tickets Hey Ken This was hilarious Glad you're having fun D liked the new concept GPT K is the best boy This was so fun to make thanks ken st in like comment view everything Hello Ken thanks for the video I've been following you since you were subs but I had never seen your resume and I didn't know you started on data science because you were a golfer I am a tennis player and I have been searching a lot about data science and I would like to start applying it on my tennis game I saw an app called SwingVision that does the statistic by its own but unfortunately is just for Ios and I just have android I would like to get a free software or build one Do you know any If not what would I have to learn to build a software like that Thanks for your help I have a bachelors in biology and masters in health science I am a PA Should I brush up on coding and do a masters Or a boot camp I work full time but make good money I just don t want to have tons of debt Never commented before but I really want to thank you Ken for your videos You've helped me a lot on my Data Science journey We appreciate your hard work Hello from Russia Good Work Mate i like the series but zoom in required for videos Watched this full series It's a great one One thing I found when you were correcting hourly to annual wage you need to calculate Average salary again As after doing hourly to annual wage min and max salary got changed Thanks how do you run the browser am getting this WebDriverException 'chromedriver' executable needs to be in PATH Please see https sites google com a chromium org chromedriver home Thanks Ken for this Thank you so much for your videos I watch them all the time I'm in a masters DS program and I feel like I'm actually on the titanic right now going down down down Here you are handing me a raft a dingy and also giving me a map to a huge lush closeby island where there's an escape airport I follow both of your contents regularly and this was such an amazing episode This was a helpful video This really shows that having a strong network is incredibly valuable Dear Ken I just finished my mechanical engineering in june Now I want to pursue my career as a data scientist but since I know it's a huge field and I can't just jump in SO I have decided to opt for data analytics from springboard So acn u plz guide me on this ken Can I get a data science internship at FAANG if I have no experience but good projects and I have done some previous internships I am starting my masters next year at SJSU How to get connected with recruiters in bay area for a data science Internship Any Idea Do you have any contacts Always making the best videos Ken Sensei i agree the Right One would not exist and it solely depends on people's available resources and their interest as well depend on their determination to continue put the effort to learn it I am headed for Ken Jee thank you for your great content Complete data noob here My work uses Excel for data analysis and reporting etc Sounds like switching to Python I'm a CS student so I love it and Jupyter could be a good move Is there a lot that can be done with these methods that Excel can't Assuming the data is already cleaned and ready to analyze When you bring up projects I understand the concept of what a project is but how do I do a project as an undergrad Should I lookup some project or think more creatively and do something unique A quick question Is it possible to run CUDA on an AMD CPU Yes CPU not talking about GPU Hi Ken Great video thanks sorry for a very basic question but how did you get the baseline numbers I am trying to get them but unable to do so i e Naive Bayes Logistic Regression Decision Tree etc Ive worked in Data Science for three years now When you go to that interview my best advice is to be studied up and give good examples of practical experience It is quite rewarding I went from k starting now at K three years I pay dollars and cents for health care that is a Cadillac Plan I get sick days a year and weeks Vacation Time I do not pay for food when I am at work they cater in meals Heres some personal advice to prepare yourself Kick all bullshit people and situations out of your life This includes All Social Media you need to focus and be prepared You need to really be strong in systems and troubleshooting skills of those systems DO NOT TAKE YOUR PHONE IN THE INTERVIEW TAKE A NOTEPAD AND HAVE YOUR OWN PEN SUGGEST A FISHER SPACE PEN IT WILL WRITE AND NOT MAKE YOU BE IN A PEN BEGGING SITUATION My interview was five people that you need to convince you are worth a shit I do remember a remarkable moment in the interview where I was asked about Social Media I stated that I had closed all my Social Media Years prior These systems are complex and use many inter relationship application features to communicate data to one another You need to be able to show this understanding You need to be able to find and isolate issues in that system You need to be able to answer questions about particular data points and features This is not for everybody I'm just going to lay it all out here if you fuck off at work and arent truly focused dont apply If you are the type of person who just wants a check who thinks showing up is good enough dont apply This is why they have so many people at the interviews for these jobs They are trying to see if you have what it takes and are disciplined I used number four applied with in the company Yes they paid for the training after selection By the way the criteria was stiff weighted grades required or you would be let go There was people in the class made it When I was hired people were hired at the same time of those have been fired Theres good money to be made here if you show you are serious they will keep raising your pay Reasons for firing one was on FaceBook all the time One was a Narcissitic Drama Queen One had tons of excuses for not completing Tasks One got fired for Sexual Harrassment These people have good money to pay and they know it PACK YER POOP TIGHT thats Marine speak for SHIT together This is great advice I'm a recent Bioinformatician graduate and I'm looking to switch to Data Science I am quite fluent in R but also have good insights in Python and Java although I steel feel a bit wobbly the fact that I'm a slow programmer is what bugs me the most Given that I already have a base in statistics programming and database theory would you be able to recommend a particular structured course that could be good for me Thanks for the websites you recommended anyways amazing channel man great content Hi Ken been following you for quite some time now and I'm amazed to see the content quality in your videos No matter what video I watch I learn something Awesome job Would you consider posting a Data Science tutorial from the scratch on your channel May be a paid subscription There are so many courses out there when I try to find one that'll help me I always get confused Basically I don't trust them and I think it'll help a lot of people if you start teaching data science Either way your AWESOME Awesome Probably the best video on landing a data science job P S The new mechanical keyboard looks great I'll find something similar like the pounding feel while smashing the space bar or enter buttons How and where can I contact recruiters Hi Ken I m a second year college student from the Philippines I like your bonus content I m all down applying for one prolly by early November Thank you for helping us aspiring data scientists Hey Ken I'm graduating this fall from my university and working really hard on a bunch of projects my thesis and networking with professors who could refer me to data science roles Nonetheless I constantly feel inadequate compared to pHD students and others I meet do you think it is possible to get into a data science job right now with just my bachelor's Much Love From Iran Nice video Ken I completely agree with you on doing data science Internships I did Data Science related Internships during my undergrad and recently grabbed a Entry level Data Science job and those small experiences helped me uplift my Profile Again Thanks Ken for such lovely guidance Big fan Ken this is so great I've had to get into some of this stuff for my work and this video really helped A LOT Thank you so much Hey im a freshman in college and i have a intrest in econ and and stats rn im majoring in computer but really not enjoying coding projects Do you recommend switching my major to stats and econ or sticking with cs Inspiring interview Daily exposure and just putting yourself out there definitely helped me on my journey as well I did not hear about MakeOverMonday but I just looked at it and it really seems like an awesome resource War face ON Love the info in this video Cool tips Ken Hi Ken great content I am torn between certificates and bootcamp I have PhD in Materials Science and masters in both Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering masters I was a very happy Data Analyst when COVID Crisis hit the industry was aviation so yeah I also have some experience with six sigma lean manufacturing and production as well What would you advise a person like me I was thinking about getting a bunch of certificates those offered by deeplearning ai on Coursera seem to be ok as opposed to IBM Data Science course this one sucks also Coursera has several courses organized by Google AWS Mongo DB etc that seem interesting as they prove presence of some practical skills in real industry used tools What do you think is the better option bootcamp or a collection of certificates I leaning towards collection of certificates this means I don't have to go through the basics of Python programming again and in the price of the bootcamp say usd I can get some interesting collection of new skill certificates or deepen those I feel need deepening How Much Math do I need in Data Science Math skills are essential in data science and machine learning I Introduction If you are a data science aspirant you no doubt have the following questions in mind Can I become a data scientist with little or no math background What essential math skills are important in data science There are so many good packages that can be used for building predictive models or for producing data visualizations Some of the most common packages for descriptive and predictive analytics include Ggplot Matplotlib Seaborn Scikit learn Caret TensorFlow PyTorch Keras Thanks to these packages anyone can build a model or produce a data visualization However very solid background knowledge in mathematics is essential for fine tuning your models to produce reliable models with optimal performance It is one thing to build a model it is another thing to interpret the model and draw out meaningful conclusions that can be used for data driven decision making It s important that before using these packages you have an understanding of the mathematical basis of each that way you are not using these packages simply as black box tools II Case Study Building A Multiple Regression Model Let s suppose we are going to be building a multi regression model Before doing that we need to ask ourselves the following questions How big is my dataset What are my feature variables and target variable What predictor features correlate the most with the target variable What features are important Should I scale my features How should my dataset be partitioned into training and testing sets What is principal component analysis PCA Should I use PCA for removing redundant features How do I evaluate my model Should I used R score MSE or MAE How can I improve the predictive power of the model Should I use regularized regression models What are the regression coefficients What is the intercept Should I use non parametric regression models such as KNeighbors regression or support vector regression What are the hyperparameters in my model and how can they be fine tuned to obtain the model with optimal performance Without a sound math background you wouldn t be able to address the questions raised above The bottom line is that in data science and machine learning mathematical skills are as important as programming skills As a data science aspirant it is therefore essential that you invest time to study the theoretical and mathematical foundations of data science and machine learning Your ability to build reliable and efficient models that can be applied to real world problems depends on how good your mathematical skills are To see how math skills are applied in building a machine learning regression model please see this article Machine Learning Process Tutorial Let s now discuss some of the essential math skills needed in data science and machine learning III Essential Math Skills for Data Science and Machine Learning Statistics and Probability Statistics and Probability is used for visualization of features data preprocessing feature transformation data imputation dimensionality reduction feature engineering model evaluation etc Here are the topics you need to be familiar with Mean Median Mode Standard deviation variance Correlation coefficient and the covariance matrix Probability distributions Binomial Poisson Normal p value Baye s Theorem Precision Recall Positive Predictive Value Negative Predictive Value Confusion Matrix ROC Curve Central Limit Theorem R score Mean Square Error MSE A B Testing Monte Carlo Simulation Multivariable Calculus Most machine learning models are built with a dataset having several features or predictors Hence familiarity with multivariable calculus is extremely important for building a machine learning model Here are the topics you need to be familiar with Functions of several variables Derivatives and gradients Step function Sigmoid function Logit function ReLU Rectified Linear Unit function Cost function Plotting of functions Minimum and Maximum values of a function Linear Algebra Linear algebra is the most important math skill in machine learning A data set is represented as a matrix Linear algebra is used in data preprocessing data transformation dimensionality reduction and model evaluation Here are the topics you need to be familiar with Vectors Norm of a vector Matrices Transpose of a matrix The inverse of a matrix The determinant of a matrix Trace of a Matrix Dot product Eigenvalues Eigenvectors Optimization Methods Most machine learning algorithms perform predictive modeling by minimizing an objective function thereby learning the weights that must be applied to the testing data in order to obtain the predicted labels Here are the topics you need to be familiar with Cost function Objective function Likelihood function Error function Gradient Descent Algorithm and its variants e g Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm IV Summary and Conclusion In summary we ve discussed the essential math and theoretical skills that are needed in data science and machine learning There are several free online courses that will teach you the necessary math skills that you need in data science and machine learning As a data science aspirant it s important to keep in mind that the theoretical foundations of data science are very crucial for building efficient and reliable models You should therefore invest enough time to study the mathematical theory behind each machine learning algorithm I love strategy Sometimes it's all about who you know It's never too late to make connections Dust off that LinkedIn profile and start messaging recruiters and employees at the company you want to work at You'd be surprised at the opportunities you can make for yourself just by simply introducing yourself

Great thumbnail for both a smash the like button and a break the interview kinda stuff Awesome video again ken Love the thumbnail Thanks for the video Thank you for this interview I just started my foray into data science with background experience I've out of school many years and that's a little intimidating so it was great to see a female coder who was able to acquire the relevant skills from scratch I'm inspired Another great video from Ken well done Do you ever plan to make videos where you actually do some data science ever again Gems for days first Really enjoy this series Great insight for a data science student like myself Cheers from Singapore Thanks a lot for the guidance This doesn't get any better There's a high pitched sound like a ringing in the background of your video A concise video thanks Sir my dataset has k observation Should I start doing analysis using entire dataset or should I first select sample out of it Because I do not know what should be the better number of observation should a sample dataset have Ken Jee Good day I'am looking for a homebased sports analytics job can you recommend some I've worked for Krossover Inc and HUDL for the past years Hi ken Jee Thanks alot for sharing these info you Just talked about my inquiries exactly Thanks a lot Thank you Thank you Ken Jee Ken when are you going to make a video of stock price prediction you've been studying for a while I'll love to learn Or you can just share some of the materials you're using Hi Ken great video mate I was looking for these types of advice I'm just starting my journey here and I enrolled in my city uni toward a master degree in DS I haven't got a strong math background but find it not difficult to learn to program What will be your advice in terms of maths This is just amazing Ken now I know that's the kind of job I wanna do for a living thank you so much for sharing Hey Ken I really appreciate your work I have an idea that you can really work upon there's a covid data science challange by C ai I think people would love to see a project on covid here on this channel Is it possible to enter the field as a self taught or is a bachelors and above required What do you think of the Harvard's CS course Thank You Ken Always to Direct us Most players are starting to shoot deeper threes anyway so I don't think moving the line back a foot and a half will do that much I could be wrong tho I have heard that software engineering position in India are quite different than in other countries especially when it comes to employee treatment and pay If that is the case I am not too sure the Sharpest Minds model will work in India unless the client was looking to move to another location Thank you Ken for sharing Can you recommend which bootcamp to take if I want an as close to realworld sort of assignment I'm also very interested to learn the deployment part of data science like having my model on a cloud that can be consumed via api with this whole thing as a docker image etc thanks You are good person Very inspiring interview and I really enjoyed Kate s energy Extremely grateful for the Makeover Monday and LinkedIn tips as I begin my baby steps into the data space The lurker part of your discussion encouraged me to comment Order out of chaos Embracing Volatility Using ML to Become More Efficient Amid Epic Uncertainty A Thanks Ken for

me and if you get down or whatever just know that you've helped me alot Ken you are really an expert on reviewing resumes Hi Ken I am sure you have answered this question s of times Sorry But what data science certification program would you recommend for me if I am about to pursue a Ph D in the health medical physiology side of things I keep seeing Datascience is that a good one to go with Hi Ken I have worked for more than years outside of data science or software field My background is Material Science I see that project experience seems quite important for job application Is internship useful for people like me Hey Ken I would like to thank you for your advice and recommendation keep it up Great content thanks Looking forward to the DLI Workshop and training Thank you for your amazing channel I have a question since I love data science and machine learning can I learn and be an expert in both of them or I have to be an expert only in one of them I mean both of them are vast fields with a lot of stuff to learn I'd like to attend Explaining Neural Networks A Causal Perspective A Two of my favourite creators join to help the community out with resume reviews awesome collaboration I am just loving your content man You are a great inspiration for me Thankyou This is good Showing instead of telling I'm curious what to do for myself though I have a DS degree and worked DS jobs but neither involved any modeling DS or otherwise An old boss thinks I should focus on business value delivery and skip the personal DS modeling projects What do you think Another great video thank you so much for these Which is best for android app development by using ML flutter odoo Thank you so much Ken as well as Tina You guys are doing great and it's really helpful for me and many more Thanks for brokering these tickets Ken Would be super keen to attend the NVIDIA Inception Premier Showcase The Top AI Startups in North America session Have you ever played around with any Fantasy basketball or fantasy football analysis prediction As a basketball fan and a data science enthusiast I loved this video I would be very interested to see how something like that moving the point line back would effect the way defensive schemes are designed and how it would change the game as a whole I have also talked to people in the past about the idea of simply removing those corner threes and having the arc be feet all the way to the sidelines I think cutting out that corner would have a huge effect on both offensive and defensive schemes This is so cool An awesome initiative ken and tina Thanks I would love to attend the following session DLI Instructor Led Workshop Fundamentals of Deep Learning DLIW Working with deep learning it's a good way I get to know more about its fundamentals and definitely there are goona be great takeaways from this session Thank You Keep Growing Yay first episode I'm so excited for this series because I think people are going to get a lot

data analytics high level use cases and problem solving methods Please let the odds be in favour i am your subscriber from past year Hey Ken I'm back to pick your brain and get your insight again lol For deploying machine learning models what cloud service is most used in the industry Obviously it depends on the model and the use case but I'm having a hard time figuring out what cloud service to use I was doing a bunch of research on turning one of my models into a productionized web app and I was trying to decide between AWS and Heroku Heroku is definitely way easier and way more hands off but would it look better from a hiring managers perspective if I took the time to learn some devops and fired up an AWS instance with my model running on it Or does it not really matter and Heroku is fine to use as it is convenient Thanks if you see this and all the amazing work you do D Hey Ken Data science college student in my final year of study I'm pretty interested in attending the Delivering AI to the Defense Intelligence Enterprise A Discussion of Strategy Particularly I'm curious to see if they'll explain the sort of breakthroughs happening in AI defense as well as whether or

AND MAKING THESE PROJECTS WILL PROVIDE ME with AN EDGE AI STARTUP SESSION WOULD BE GREATE Second First Hi Ken Many thanks for your interesting and insightful sharing I 'm from China and have been following you on youtube I worked for Fortune companies European American in different roles research application marketing in the manufacturing industry in the past ten years I like learning and taking challenges My current challege is to redirect my career development into data science field to keep up with intelligent era I hope to master the big data analysis skill and apply it to the digital transformation of manufacturing industry I started learning machine learning and data analysis respectively years ago and took several on line courses on Udacity Coursera DataCamp I'm major in material science and engineering much different from CS mathematcs or statistics There's so much to pick up Everytime I feel like learning more I soon found out much more to learn It's quite overwhelming Your sharing helped me know better about the world of data science As you advised I'm now working on the Kaggle competition Even though the course I took before had several projects based on the Kaggle datasets and competition it's my first time to participate in on my own Besides this week I started uploading my work to github and Kaggle to build up my profile I love this I read Atomic Habits earlier this year and it inspired me to add more structure to my life If I'm being honest some of my habits have stuck better than others Do you struggle with this and how do you tackle it Thanks Great video I'm a mech engineer and have a couple of months in Codecademy data science and computer science I have used Python before in a college projects of statistics and vehicles but now I really want to be able to feel condident saying I use it Learning by doing projects and uppering the level is the best option keep on with the good advice i just cant solve kaggle problems should i quit this field its been months already I really like the Notebook Viewer idea makes it very simple to follow through with code I've just tried it out for the first time at https nbviewer jupyter org seems simple enough just copy and paste url of the notebook you want to be used Haha the part at the beginning really got me D There is some truth to this it is just like overfitting a model but in a different way Interesting interview for sure D KenJeePodcast Thanks for great videos ken that helps alot U r the best simply awesome videos Aren't you data snooping the test set by doing a train test split after EDA Also great series Very helpful Nice I started to learn machine learning a week ago soon will join u after finishing basic courses Hi Ken Do you play fantasy football of premier league Really helpful insights Ken Great Video Mr Jee I have one question he talks a lot about A B testing Can you describe what that means for a beginner data scientist like myself hi Ken really helpful video Do you have any examples of how to include Github and Git into my routine you mentioned it at the end of the video Do i just focus on getting my project on github or focus on how to store it and present it if thats the case is there a tutorial on it or would you be interested in doing some tutorials Or is it something totally different Keep up the good work Thank you so much Hey man Really glad to find individuals such yourself I will be joining a bit late but starting today For sure each person should apply himself the best method suited to their own motivation and capabilities Myself I started with Data Camp its user interface and the app helps me a lot to engage on it and will be using the hashtag you displayed Keep it up please you are honest and very approachable in your videos your first person perspective is one of the sparks I needed Thank you very much man You really rock Regards from Barcelona good stuff One question what about restoration renewal We aren't machines We need to cycle though and schedule rest also Hi Ken Just found your channel recently and it s been an amazing resource for me I m new to data science and as a former athlete I m hoping to work in sports analytics eventually However I have a background working in product creation in the apparel industry for years Based on what you ve said a few times it seems my best path is working in data science in apparel before transitioning into sports If I wanted to start building my portfolio would it be weird to have projects in both categories Should I only show apparel projects now and do sports for fun A little confused on how I should present myself Thanks for having Jeremie on Ken I actually wanted to ask an question that i am currently doing stats as my classwork and i am pretty much enjoying with along with some algebra But i wanted to know that is calculus and others math are cruciel I am not good at it Hey ken what is your opinion about moving from data analyst role to more of manager role also how many years of work experience should one have before the transformation Is years sufficient can you send the pdfs i'm already equipped with basic python knowledge how do i begin Data Science When sharpestminds com will be launching in india Great piece Hopefully they come to Argentina Amazing interview My only feedback would be add timestamps to the video description outlining of each of the topics discussed Would be helpful if I wanted to come back and re listen to a part of the interview Really enjoyed this awesome discussion between Jeremie and you Ken Learned a lot especially liked the perspectives from the physics and entrepreneurship point of views on approaching data science Hey Ken Thanks for the video what about Computer Information Systems Thank you Hey Ken I have question regarding a portfolio website Is it bad if stole my portfolio website github page from someone else I found this https orysyastus github io github pages website and I really like the way this person has everything laid out and I was just gonna fork it and put my own information and my own projects on it But does that look bad to a future employer Like I was too lazy to create my own portfolio from scratch And the other thing I worry about it is what if like other people all had the same idea as me and then my portfolio page looks identical to other people that all forked from this same github page lol Curious to hear your insight on these concerns thoughts I've had when it comes to making a portfolio website I'm a product manager that is looking to build up data analytics skills Do I really need to go deep into programming to build a data science background Wow I also studied physics at university Great guest and cool interview I wish life saw stepwise regression Hello Data professor and Ken jee I would like to say thank for your efforts I have one question why he put link https dataprofessor github io Ken Portfoloio instead of local http localhost we have to make local host to dynamic site He put already exist website link in atom text editor What about he crated local site he did not use it Can you explain or give solution why he used it

the first one saying this but it would be great if Sharpest Minds opened up in India and other developing countries Data Science Jay and I were just talking about this unique space awesome to hear from Jeremie and Ken as always I applied in hopes that I could get mentorship when it comes to looking for an entry level data analyst job All I got was it said I am a bit too early and should brush up on my fundamentals My goal is to someday be a data scientist but I realize that is going to take me several months if not years to obtain such role and have since been solely focusing on acquiring enough skills to land an entry level data analyst job I was unable to get assistance from the VA to pursue a master's in data science degree so now I am left to my own defenses in learning these skills on my own I have been using Python Pandas Numpy Matplotlib Seaborn for nearly a year now I have completed a handful of data analyst projects and posted them on GitHub I have over a year with using SQL I am now taking a Coursera course on Tableau and working on an Oracle Database Administrator certification course How much longer will it take for me to land an entry level data analyst job I am doing what I can to not have to take out more student debt for a CS degree Hello Jeremie Harris Sorry but SharpestMinds is not operating in India We have a lot of MOOC's available and it becomes confusing in which one to take To be practical or theory Especially I get confused like when I take up theory I tend to take theory as I do not understand the things used and why and when doing theory I tend that I am lacking the practical I end up really end doing absolute nothing I really am looking for such a thing and would really help not only for me but all of the aspirants in India Please may it available for enthusiast like us Please can you make it available in India Thanks Piyush Talele SharpestMinds the team and company are both truly amazing and really the best mentorship programs in this space Only request to them would be to expand to India soon I remember hearing about this on Kiril s podcast SDS first view first like and the very first comment A great video with so much knowledge and handy pick up things to improve for oneself That portfolio looks smooth any possibility you might do another video on portfolio building feat data professor Would love it I'm currently a CS student Would that help me land a data scientist job even without acquiring a masters degree in data science Hi Ken i am currently doing masters in statistics and thinking about doing an M Sc in data Scienc After graduating my main focus is landing a job in statistics related field Which one do you think is better M Sc in Statistics or M sc in Data Science from the perspective of landing a job Guys how to make skills enclosed in the box eg Python Keras Check Those look so awesome How to make them in LibreOffice Help Thanks Ken Jee for the sharing another awesome video His clean and neat CV is something I want to make on my own Is there any paid non paid platform where I can make the CV in similar template Can we please talk about how he actually replied to everyone Hey Ken Can I use this model for my work I m thinking of creating something similar for soccer Thank you so much Ken You are truly amazing hi now you have sub Hey Ken I've got a question for you related to projects and stuff you look for on a entry level data scientists resume portfolio I'm trying to decide what I should do for my next project and I'm unsure what will look better on my resume Project A Kaggle finish top in a Kaggle competition and write a blog post outlining each step of the process and explaining my thought process of why I chose certain algorithms and my understanding of certain concepts Project B solve a cool problem or answer a question with data science Pull data from an API database to get experience with SQL or collect my own data source through scraping Clean the data Do some advanced feature engineering with the data Do some testing on different models to figure out which one performs the best Create a website and put the end model into production write a blog post about the project and its results Would love to hear your thoughts on this and if you value placing well on Kaggle more than a personal project that solves an interesting question Cheers With recruiting season underway this series has been very helpful to me Ken This was such a brilliant walkthrough I thought the basic github pages video before was good enough but this produces quite a professionally finished product in mins and FREE So happy that you made this question once you ve done an initial commit and the website is up how do you then do a small update Do you edit it locally again and upload the whole public folder again to the GitHub repo Or is there some more efficient way Review someone's resume or portfolio who applied for internship that would be great help Great analysis as always Ken I have a query I have been working as a Data scientist for past years in IT services firm and have delivered projects in Engineering domain customers in manufacturing aero auto etc Even though I have some good projects the ones I delivered for the customers to showcase on CV I don't have a proper GitHub profile because I cant recreate the projects I did in GitHub because of customer project confidentiality In this case what would be your advice on building a solid GitHub profile which datasets project I can work on Hey Ken Would it be alright if I just put links to my Kaggle notebooks in my GitHub portfolio or are there some important benefits from basically copying into GitHub repos Great video Cool lately one great portfolio follows the next one haha D Great to see all of these clean portfolios Any recommended text books hello man could you address the gap issue if someone has couple of years gap since he she graduated is this gonna be a problem in industry to get a job after years even he she gets certificates from data science or somewhere else this person's core computer science concepts are still fresh please give me a broad view of this issue or post a video if that's possible thank you Hey Ken so I have a project where I train a neural network to determine if a piece of text is toxic or not However during the exploration portion of the data racial and homophobic slurs are shown graphs and word cloud to emphasize that they are the most common toxic words How would I go about saying that I do not condone these words Great video that option for light and dark theme was really unique Loving this series Awesome job Pranay Hey ken can you do another series of building a data science project form scratch That series was a great learning experience for me thanks for what you re doing for us The only project I've completed so far is the titanic set should I even bother putting this into a portfolio seeing as how everyone has seen it before and it has solutions posted I m new to your channel and loved this video Thanks for posting these tips I'm completing my Masters degree in data science in a few days and this video gave me an idea of how I need to set up my CV Thanks keep up the good work Definitely agree with you Ken the portfolio website is nice and clean project readme on GitHub are well structured data visualizations are impressive great job Pranay Hey Ken Thank you very much for taking your time D The feedback was really helpful I'm a data analyst freelancer hope to connect with data analysts System requirements for Data science Best Are we now choosing favorite children now Just teasing great work Ken and very clean portfolio Pranay Almost k Ken Keep up the great videos Hey Ken I have two questions regarding CV Should the projects and work experience be above educational qualifications Would you recommend a pages CV which is much clearer and larger in fonts or a single page CV like that of this guy Another awesome video in this series Really liked your suggestion on how to present the most important key point of a project at the top so anybody can get what its solving in the first seconds to mint Thanks again Ken for making this video You make Data Science look sexy Hi Ken I was recently made redundant and decided to take advantage of the chance to return to the type of work that makes me happy problem solving I decided to learn Python and became very interested in data analysis and data science A few weeks in I found your channel and that is when I really found direction Thanks I did have one quick question that I cannot find covered elsewhere in your videos I like all your advice on CV and LinkedIn information but what would you put as your current job title in my situation paid for several months but not actually working for an employer Thanks again for your amazing guidance Hey Ken amazing video I always appreciate your material I m currently working in a fairly big bank as a data analyst the job doesn t require the use of very strong programs excel and Adobe at best Before I started this job I wasn t on going into DS but now that I am would you say it d be a good move to do a master s in DS to try and move into more pure blooded data scientist roles Or is it realistically possible to do that by self teaching with the help of kaggle etc for context I have a solid BSc in Maths Stats so I ve had a little exposure to R and Python Thanks in advance Hi can anyone help I am trying to make a loop to copy and classify images i have according to category and image index number from a csv file however I am only managing to keep looping in the same spot this is the code i tried glob index os walk iterrows itertuples everything Can someone please indicate what I'm doing wrong pls pls lps help i am getting so frustrated and annoyed at this import glob import shutil import pandas as pd import numpy as np import os df pd read csv 'Data entry csv' df head a a df iloc i b b df iloc i Cardiomegaly print type new str src r'L xrayChestImages images images ' dest r L chest xray for ind in df index if b 'Cardiomegaly' new str str a new str str b dest os path join dest new

video and fix it the same as you then I copy the source code but the salary estimate keeps repeated do you have any solution Thanks a lot for these videos they are really helpful The best data science interview I've seen thanks Awesome Video Ken I have done bachelor in logistics and supply chain management from India I feel I need a ms data science to fully adapt and get a job What u say best way to transition into data science field I feel I won't get any job related to data science bcoz I don't have previous educational knowledge Hi can you help me to decide what should I can do Like I am working on SAP CMMS as end user But I start using power bi for my trends and other calculations I felt I am good in learning DAX and I like to organize data in power i by making data model ad etc Now I want to change my career to IT field Can I go with SAP HANA to or PYTHON like I don t know which is best for future job option or can we relate both I imagine Andrew is one of those people who is just really pleasant to talk to There is just something about the way he communicates that is just so captivating Loved the interview Where can I find the file Public Hello Ken How can I get to reach you Kindly I work on the English premier league but when I take FTHG AND FTAG feature then model given me above then accuracy but when I remove FTHG AND FTAG then model give me accuracy around to accuracy on training and testing data so what can I do please help me sir Use DataRobot to accelerate what are the odds of self teaching data science and landing a job in comparison with software engineering brah when the video was minimized and you know it start moving i though you are flithy frank Awesome concept for a series Great advise Ken thank you for sharing Great Video Awesome interview Finally learned about your background Andrew I had no idea you were pre med Also super entertaining Ken your interview series keeps getting better and better Keep up the amazing work Thanks for the great videos as always Ken Jee I love your content Andrew is such a great guy as well Please make more project related videos I would love that Sorry for my second comment and request in the same video but it would be very nice if you could do a video on the possibilities of transitioning to Data Science coming from a social sciences background beyond economics sociology anthropology history and or any field that requires analytical thinking and may involve qualitative research I'm thinking either of a research context ex masters or PhD students or simply BS BA graduates Thank you again Congratulations for expanding your channel's scope beyond the US Ken Jee You are doing an amazing job I'd like to thank you in the name of non US to be data scientists and ask you if possible and convenient to do a video on making it to the Data Science field in the Brazilian context if it is the case that you already know any successful Brazilian data scientist Best wishes Wow Thank you so much for this Gave him a follow Also I noticed that you have a BS in Economics I am currently an Economics major too and am interested in your hearing about your journey from Econ to Data Science I wonder if you'd be willing to make some videos about that because I would appreciate your insight and advice Thank you Nice work Hi Great videos I have started learning DS using kaggle and coursera online course by university of Michigan Right now I am doing it on my laptop which has windows i th gen U processor and mx gpu My question is in future which hardware should I opt for Should I go for pc or mac Hey It was kind of advanced for me to do it on my own What should I learn before doing these projects can you share some source Thanks for the amazing video Dude I just discovered you but I love your videos They have been really helpful I majored in ecnomics and graduated this june and am now doing my masters in quantitative economics and I'm trying to figure out what I need to learn on the side Thanks for making these A question here Ken As a beginner I'm going through lots of books and tutorials to comprehend the concepts of each algorithm and how to apply them basically using them in a project Many of the suggested projects for newbies have been done and posted by thousands of people including bootcamp projects Even if I do everything on my own thoroughly it's still the same dataset project and approach I'm wondering if it's ok to add them to my portfolio at least until I do a little more advanced projects Man that s goofy You re the first person other than me that I ve seen that likes that specific Korean Barbeque jerky when you re making the smoothie Thanks Ken I really like the idea of tip on focusing on the outcome not the algorithms I'm guilty of spending all my energy on trying to show off a complex algorithm rather than why I'm doing the project in the first place i e what will it help answer solve and then how to convey that answer I'm going to go back and update a few recent projects Truly a success story Thank you so much for doing this KenJee and congrats to Andrew from dataleap D keep up the good work Hey Ken Jee hope you are doing great I jave a question in your opinion how long it takes to become a good data scientist or data analyst for someone who is good in statistics and using excel beginner in programming knows the basics of sql python and tableau I want to ask you a question and hope you will answer I am willing to be a data scientist After years can have a job because i am in a college right now and student of statistics and computer science program And my question is will data science job die until i get the job or data science will die in the future Premiering now Take a pee break https www youtube com watch v J n Fh eXA thanks for doing this Ken I'm transitioning from a med student to data scientist Currently applying to masters programs Your videos have been really informative Thanks I tried to implement this code using sublime and run it on windows powershell I got an error on line tweets query tweets unexpected keyword argument begindate Does he have a LinkedIn Great interview As someone from Europe I am particularly interested in the entire process outside of the US since currently there is not a lot of information on this topic online One small note at some points in the video especially when the audio of you talking is a bit low the music makes it a bit more difficult to follow along Still an awesome discussion tho Awesome Video Bro Crazy excited Much love to Ken for the whole shebang What

interview You're the man Ken Just started my journey with Data Science and your content is a must for all beginners Keep up with great work This is perfect Please add more like this and explain why you are doing the steps Most teach but dont explain the reasoning A series on basic DS projects would be awesome I wish I had access to this sort of video when I was starting my career Hey Ken I am doing Masters in Business intelligence and data analytics and i have started with Python for now and been a month already Should I learn R by side with Python because it s in our syllabus or should I start ML now Also i am almost done with Statistics too Please suggest Also if anything you can suggest me from your end it will be really helpful thank you Hi Ken I am a PhD graduate in Information and Communication Engineering India My research work was in the domain of Wireless communications I want to become a Data Scientist Please suggest me the steps I should take in order to achieve my goal Is it ok to gain knowledge through online ed tech platforms Is certification mandatory in order to become a data scientist Hope you ll answer my queries Thanking you in advance THANKS FOR THIS AWWEEEEEESOMEEEEE VIDEO YOURE THE BEST When I create a local server with Hugo I expected it to be running at localhost but then it's created at localhost Portfolio instead Does anyone know how to prevent it Great stuff Can you recommend any of the datasets in kaggle to begin with Really good interview Ken Just one suggestion as audience Do not add background music it is annoying This is the far best video that i saw on my journey as data scientist i really wanna thank you because this was exactly what i wanted to hear Thanks Ken Jee for bringing Vijay to your channel Vijay was absolutely inspiring It's very motivating for students like me who aspire to work in the field of Data Science Thank you That's so cool I wanna ask you one question K'Jee from india how many views you will get in your total views I am interested in predictive analytics especially in the non profit human services organizations Any thoughts I ve been kind of afraid to ask this question but what do you think is the major difference between a data scientist and statistician Sometimes the line gets very thin between the two Can i pursue ML AI after electrical engineering Bhai Good day Do we need math for DS Amazing Ken Thank you for bringing to us such Data Experts who share their story Just want to let you know these are highly inspirational and moving Thank you Really Just found your channel a few days ago and absolutely love your content I watched your Data Science Project from sctach series and found it very beneficial I was wondering if you could make a video targeted at beginners as to what kind of EDA we should be doing depending on our data maybe explain some of the statistics knowledge needed when picking features to use in models etc not necessarily how to create plots as you did this in your EDA episode of the ds project series Thanks for putting out content this useful for free keep it up man wow I literally just learned how to do this for one of my old projects Thanks for sharing

the most important take away from here Thank you so much Ken It's inspiring and encouraging Do we need to learn programming to become a data scientist How about a video of making the transition from graduate school in the life sciences to data science I know you can get data science certificates What steps should people with PhDs not in CS eg biology genomics take while they re in grad school Never knew Naveen Richards was a data scientist st view st like st comment Are there any people here who managed to get into DS with an undergraduate degree in CS I am still first year but I wonder whether it is possible to get a DS job as a fresh CS undergrad Hi there Ken As always your video is really helpful for someone who just started learning about data science in the line and why would you apply the lower upper change only to data desc head instead of data head Thanks for the informative video I learned a lot from it Hello Kan I started it late but was highly recommended by a friend to do it But I am missing the track like which videos belong to which day Could you suggest how should I filter that which video belong to day day etc Eagerly looking for your help Thanks Ken just seeing this Also that is a sick LLBean fleece For real no joke I had one identical to it and wouldn't replace it with anything Comfy as a MF'r Love you're videos and the no non sense fluff approach Just getting started in DS Python R and Sports Analytics but have set goals and want to take it far Hello Mr Ken Keep going brother My well wished will always be with you I hope one day I will be successful just like you Can't Hurt Me and Deep Work are great books Just a little suggestion it would be much easier to create and share your profile on Goodreads com Thanks Ken I'm a spanish computer professional I'm trying to introduce in ML world to change my career and your videos have help me to center my studies Hello Ken Thanks for making this informative video I have finished the basics of python and the Pandas course on Kaggle I'm planning to pick Geospatial analysis and my next pick Am I good to go to proceed to hands on these projects If not could you please refer me to what should I pick next Loving this project resume series it's just full of useful tips I'm just about to start an MSc Data Science and I'm planning to do some project work to complement the course content I saw that you did your undergraduate in Economics do you have any tips for an economics undergraduate transitioning to DS Note to self come back here after I build some projects Thanks KenJee I think I messed up the order Setup portfolio page showcase projects Work on projects to showcase Coming soon I definitely used screenshots of tables in business school Glad to see you having fun Just purchased your course on Udemy Amazing Anyway this is my first Kaggle project https www kaggle com miguelrosales data analysis of house prices I hope you can check it Ken Thank you as always Thank you Ken Jee for this amazing content Now a days it becomes my habit to watch your channel and more I watch your contents I learn something new and that's how you became my inspiration I am a M Sc Operational Research student and I need some career advise guide in the field of Data Science Should I ask my doubts here or is there any way to ask them Please let me know Thanks for these amazing contents again How can a novice start journey about statistics and probability for data science If possible could you please provide any resources books so that we can learn enough to land myself into Data Science field Ken 'Don't but my course ' Me Went ahead and purchased the course during watching the video I love it when the video is exactly what's on the title No dragging and down to the point Thank you sir please improve audio quality It's great as always Ken He has got an amazing project Thanks for sharing Oh man Ken I'm just starting my GA capstone project and I was always wondering when you would review a capstone project This is awesome Maybe I'll shoot you a message when my capstone is done after October Thanks always for what you do very cool project The detail in the ReadMe is impressive As a relative newbie this is quite intimidating to me Wondering how long it will take me to get to this level of proficiency Thanks a ton Ken The project you selected was really awesome on showing one of the best in class documentation Learned quite a few points from it Someday I shall submit my own project for your review Thank you again Ahilan for submitting your project for me to review If you would like me to review your projects portfolios or resumes please comment below and email me at kenjee ds gmail com DaysOfData https www youtube com watch v uXLnbdHMf w ab channel KenJee thank you so much for making these videos Very informative my yrs has just begun Already the th episode wow It feels like you just started this series yesterday and now episodes in you covered so many different resumes and projects I believe in general talking more about the other side is very valuable in conversation We as humans just like talking about our own views and when a company is hiring they of course want to know what they can get from a candidate Focusing on value we can create rather than the value we can receive Excellent lessons for any stage of DS thanks for staying up so late editing this Hi I am a junior DS big thanks to you for inspiring videos that help me to keep going Good work Awesome video Ken Cool I'm early today Great advice on stressing the value that one can bring to an organization I really like the organization and layout of the Hotel Review NLP project great job Ahilan The class balancing is also a great way to make the classifier less bias great job Oh and nice mechanical keyboard by the way Hello ken I am a full stack developer and high school student in grade I have a sound knowledge in this field I want to be a data scientist And in front of me there are two options One is Go to college and take computer science then learn data science nd one is Don't go to college and do self study and projects and take some online certificates as data scientist and machine learning engineer and I am ready to give the efforts But I am kind of confused Sometime I think I should do self study and real life projects but It also concern be whether it will be a good decision not to go to college Can you kindly give a advice which will be better because you have a masters degree in computer science Thank you What do you think about codewars leetcode Does it feel relevant to advance coding skills in python to a really high level For example does it make sense to invest time to become kata in codewars or to solve medium difficult level in leetcode Thanks Hello Ken Jee and everyone I'm an Industrial engineering graduate so I have good foundation in statistics and its applications All I want is to solve real world problems through data which is why I'm pursuing data science or to be specific Machine Learning I'm kindda frustrated because my work right know is just using SQL to make data visualizations for other teams the company I'm working for I feel that I'm undervaluing myself I need your advice what should I do to be able to get a job that actually analyzes data and giving insight into it You look like shaved Gilfoyle tbh Wonderful conversation Danny showed first as very kind and tender person and then showed as a wise sensei master This conversation gave me a lot of insights for using social media Thanks for the content I come from a background in experimental psychology I ve worked a ton with statistics software packages and both quantitative and qualitative data and I ve finished the MA degree involving a thesis I currently work in the clinical side of psych and want to get back into something involving data stats marketing and ai I have experience with blogging web design and SEO I m considering the route of self study I want to start working on some projects and continue working at my full time job and see where it may take me Guys also checkout deepwork by cal newpot You will be fascinated reading that I think I'm going to watch this when I wake up every day for a couple weeks things CAPTIVATE and DIGITAL MINIAMLISM are great I aim to read the rest on your shelf ooooo alchemy thanks for sharing such VALUED content Keep it up cheers Would a BA in math and a minor in data science be good enough for a masters in data science Hi Ken thanks a lot for these informative videos For a beginner to whom this video is intended how many weeks would it take to complete these preliminary projects Lets say if one were to devote a couple of hours every day to work on these hours is an guesstimate because at this preliminary stage most learners are balancing full time job or education I ask this because I want to follow the path but not have unrealistic expectations and beat myself at the same time I would like to know what a reasonable timeframe for completion would be Hi Ken First of all thank you for all the great videos that you are making I just discovered your channel and I really appreciate it As I have no internship or education directly link to programming I would like to create a Github page to show to the company that I'm still competent I'm looking for a job as data analyst in the oil and gas area Do you have some ideas about projects that I could do Thank you in advance Hi Ken Your videos are tremendously helpful Thank you I need some direction please I was trying to replicate your steps here When I ran 'scores cross val score reg x y cv scoring 'neg mean squared error' ' Here was the bug I got ValueError 'neg mean squared error' is not a valid scoring value Use sorted sklearn metrics SCORERS keys to get valid options Could you assist please It s so hard to do a project out of new idea feel like just quitting this field minths and still a noob in this field kills me from inside makes me wanna pull my hair Everytime I see a blank Jupiter notebook Why don't you use ig ken I wish I could follow you Love you bro Thanks a lot for these videos thanks for the algo Hi the data analysis thing looks so awesome and I think I would have the time learn a few things since I'm currently in the last year of my Senior years I want to enter the data science field but also want to take Math as a major in college Do you think it would be beneficial for me to take Math as major Hey man I was actually wondering if I can also write for your medium publication I'm really passionate about sports and I could work hours on hours observing statistics in the NBA NHL ATP tennis MLB you name it If I could somehow send you my work to see if you like it that would be awesome I am an international student in Seattle with MS in Civil Engineering BS Civil Engineering I am one year into my career as civil engineer and already feel that this is not for me I am learning little bit of python on my free time after hour workshift on construction and have made little progress Started this journey three weeks ag I tried messaging and talking to other people who switched from civil to data science but nobody is even replying on Linkedin and I am kind of lost I have determined to keep learning python taking some data science online free course codeacademy udemy etc I wonder how tough it would be to land a first internship into data science as somone from civil engineering I feel like I am pretty strong with stats but I am doing coding for the first time Are there any data analytics companies conultants that specialise in data anayltics for construction infrastructure energy business where my civil engineering would help me better understand the problem Thank you Ken I found your channel this Monday but just managed time to go through your videos today on weekend because of my hectic work on construction Thanks I did this on my own data and the r squared is and average of the mean absolute error is Anyone got super off results like this zero dislikes wow Hey Ken I have been working as a Mainframe developer with years experience I have been quite well with Python as well Right now I have enrolled myself in a DataScience MS course and trying to build my github and kaggle profile I have made an account in Medium and started blogging as well But I have never made a website except using blogger and wordpress Just wanted to know about your thoughts on having a personal website Thanks Hi ken i m aspiring to be a sports analyst and pursuing a degree in data science will my data sci knowledge help me in this feild Hey Ken i have applied for a months data science course which will probably help me get a job by the time it's over Do you think I'll be able to grasp it all in such a short period of time with basic programming knowledge in python As always thanks for that great video Hey everyone how's your progress I'm sharing a template I created you can make a copy and use it to track your daily Data Science activities https docs google com spreadsheets d V FKGREWCjv sJ pADT iMoxTw BfKOraGKCpYB MY edit gid Love the content Ken thanks a lot and wanted to ask you what can I do next after completing python disciplines and atomic habits are amazing books You are a beast Hi Ken I am not able perform below code in python giving me error df 'min salary' min hr apply lambda x int x split ' ' When I am using then it's giving me max value but not min with Hey ken I resonated very closely with you on the last point of 'focusing on one imp thing' as for a couple of months i was learning data analytics sql tableau excel etc and ml and dl Nlp Cv all at same time and was going nowhere even after putting atleast hrs everyday This last point made me realize how important it is to focus on one thing at time Now i'm going to start with data analytics find a job and build up from there Again thanks Ken Wow look at those handwritten checklists notes the clocks with different time zones amazing Thanks ken for this video what worked for me is spirituality Yes I am an Indian its just enjoying the present moment and being in the present that's it You can't describe in words what sprirtuality does to you but its just watching the things happening around you and not being affected by them Karma Yoga as it is written in Bhagwat Geeta Hi Ken nice video I really liked the last tip I've been concious that focusing on one thing could bring in way more results than juggling too may at once However I have this irrational fear that I'll lose out on time I could be using to do all of those other things which is why everything is always top of the priority list The timing couldn't have been any better on this video Really truly thank you Actually am working in some other domain but want to transist my carier as a data scientist given time constraint if i study for hrs only daily Can i become a data scientist in days Provided i learned coding statistics bit of lib so far Plz reply YouTube strangers Haha Great video never would I expect jump roping in a data science video There are so many gems in this video Please make more videos like these Hey ken I am a Full stack developer with years of experience And want to be a data scientist but have no CS or related degree So if I take a bootcamp and certificate both and some online courses in Udemy of Calculus Linear Algebra Statistics and probability Will it lend me a job of data scientist This video was very inspirational in terms of how I can measure my personal success The pillar of celebrating your successes really spoke to me because I'm in the midst of interviews for internships and after passing some of the initial rounds I shared my hard work with my supportive friends and this motivated me to study even harder for the final rounds of those interviews Thanks for the motivational content as always ' awesome stuff here Ken Hi Ken Thanks for the videos I have been watching for a while and just went back to school this fall Motivation has been a struggle and this video is right on point for me Your pillars help me realign and rethink my approach to school day job and child also going to school from home I have been a data guy for years and figured it is time to formalize by background and experience with a degree Appreciate your sharing and keep up to solid work great content as always Thanks man Great content Narrowing the scope of things I am trying to learn is great advise another great video I learned this the hard way after spending months jumping on to follow every tutorial related to data science I could find on youtube statistics data analysis data visualization deep learning etc It was very overwhelming and didn't do much for my confidence as a beginner I think it was one of Krish Naik's video called How To Learn Data Science Smartly that saved me where he explains why we shouldn't try to learn each aspect of data science separately but rather find some data science projects and learn different topics with context by reverse engineering Hi I'm a MBA graduate with some months of experience in HR now I'm thinking about changing my career to data science I signed up in Kaggle and started learning python should I do any certifications course to get a job And also I'm now is it too late to start from zero pls suggest me something It is awesome and very motivating to see how you evolved so drastically Thank you a lot for sharing this about three years ago I also was mostly unproductive and did not get a lot of stuff done I have been continually trying to make small improvements and I have gotten a long way but I still have an even longer way to go of course I really paused for a moment when you talked about the aspect of focus I have been guilty in the past of trying to do different things at the same time and as a result I have experienced dissatisfaction with the outcomes I will try to narrow my goals down in the future and only focus on one or very few different things at a time When you said that you don't think you have come far I wanted to add one detail I don't remember exactly where I have this way of thinking from but it was very inspiring to me Even if you as in you personally do not feel that you have achieved that much it can be motivating to think of people as a network in general When someone focuses on their own success they might see that they have done average or somewhat well but maybe their actions have affected someone else And that person affects someone else else So while I know the feeling of always trying to achieve more and always wanting to be as successful as possible I can definitely say that through your channel you have reached a lot of people And maybe you have influenced or or even more of those people to do something And maybe those have influenced their own and so on I know for a fact that you have influenced me for the better and motivated me to start actively trying daysofdata and becoming more interested in habit building So I wanted to say thank you from me and for everyone else you influenced at least a little bit You're awesome one thing i started a few days ago and has helped me a lot is I write down goal for my next day and accomplish atleast one thing early in the morning this gives me a headstart and once i start the process of completing my goals it becomes significantly easier to fulfill them Can you Make a Video About writing an article like medium How to Start and How to Write Useful Content with good edit and format I swear some of the things you said reminded of some of the books you mention the importance of habits and identity Those two go hand in hand together and one best way to describe oneself is by what we do on a consistant basis Hence if you can chance your habits you can chance your identity The growth mindset has been cited in many different book tough I have habits of highly successful people Motivation clearly sucks as a base strategy since it's volatile Don't get me wrong it's good to have sometimes but view it rather as a very good friend who has MANY friends always willing to help giving a lot of it when it can but who can't really always be there on account of having so many people to help Motivation is VERY popular these days if you catch my meaning Another thing about identity and accounting and something I've talked about before is to give yourself proof of what you've accomplished so far and what you are doing right now and a bullet journal for this and feedback since ppl won't always be there to give it to you this is perfect for this Make sure to add the proper tracker to it And when you feel one of those tracker that's what Ken Jee here said about about fist pumping and being proud of yourself yep it's very to do that with a tracker and a bullet journal I can't tell you how many YES I've shouted when marking one PS daysofdata If you watch that video with the intent of applying the advice here to your daysofdata you might be doing more than of them and good days they might be just saying I assume this should count for your challenge in that case PS Haven't told you that before but it seems we have something in common https www youtube com watch v TnqZl blT E P i think ken is transitioning into a film maker more so than a data scientist Why those three clocks have three different time showing Thanks for the video My energy has been really zapped the last month from depression and sometimes I just need a little re frame of my mindset Last night was the first time I opened up some coding learning material Thanks Mr Jee My main takeaways were you also enjoy Golden Island Jerky and we're the same age Just kidding Great video and consistent with a lot of things that I've read on self improvement D Hello there How did Deepak create a portfolio like this It's awesome I already have a github and LinkedIn detailed but not a portfolio it's gorgeous and very attractive I really want to explore more in depth this option especially because I'm searching for a job right now Nice video BTW I just discovered you you really seems a nice guy Thanks for watching everyone I hope this video helps you on your DaysOfDataChallenge Books Atomic Habits https amzn to

I'll be checking these books out Intrigued by the thumbnail but stayed for the thoughtful tips Accountability explained simply letting others down is a lot scarier than letting yourself down Also the editing game is getting upped the fence on the left looks slightly surprised This is an awesome motivational video Ken Thanks for sharing your pillars of success For me learning to say no can work wonders to give back time that I could use to be productive and take me a step closer toward reaching life s goals As Jim Rohn puts it Time is more valuable than money You can get more money but you cannot get more time It's inspiring and motivating Ken Thank you so much You Are an Inspiration Keep Going Much Love Exactly the thing that I needed Thanks Ken I started days project with you but I couldn't do it regularly this helps a lot thanks for motivating me to study data science along with my college Pecs of peace Please make more videos like this I did all of these to move forward domino's over too many plates not to say that each domino has up to facets but dominos Really this motivates me to keep going Thank you ken Noice video as always Very good content i see you from Argentina Beautiful and motivating Hey could you please get back to me on discord question if someone has statistics bachelor degree but never worked on the major is it easy to start the career after years of graduation Until now I used to take on Github notebooks but I think Kaggle is a great option too Plus there are a lot of introductory notebooks on kaggle if you need to dive in a new concept Ken you never fail to amaze with such useful stuff This was awesome Dude your interviews are awesome You should think about starting a podcast It would be cool to listen to just audio on Spotify or such Is it possible to learn data science and get u know a real job if u didn't study it in school just Learn it by yourself can we add url instead of user names i feel im gonna quit this field the barrier to entry is too high and i cant build my project out of novel ideas I'm excited to join DaysOfData No joke I have the same shirt I got in It's a sign I will wear it on my journey Thank you So I have couple of questions related to transformation techniques log boxcox etc Do I need to use same transformation technique on all the features even though that technique may not be good for other feature Do I need to use transformation on dependent variable too Thanks in advance again I would like to add that you are doing amazing work Hey Ken I m Recent graduate with a Biology and Business Finance and Econ undergraduate degree and some familiarity with data analysis Excel Stata SQL a little I have a job in management consulting starting in January and am looking to strengthen my data skills Which of these If any would be best for me Hello Ken I m from Brasil This is courses is for beginer o k I started today by watching this video I guess now I need to get a twitter account Thanks for the kick in the butt I greatly appreciate your channel I am always trying to figure out if it's best to concentrate on learning how to use one tool like Pyramid and be proficient especially when you don't quite have the time to learn to code as well What's your take Hi Ken this was a very informative video I am a NET MVC Full stack developer with years of exp but I am really fascinated with the concepts of NLP and CV I set forth on my learning journey months ago using MOOCs to have a fair idea of ML Now I have basic background into different models plotting EDA etc and Python Should I first perfect ML before moving to NLP or should I change career into ML and then continue to pursue NLP How should I set a timeline around this Will my exp still be valid Hi thanks for sharing with us this tips At the moment I m studying physics degree and also learning python skills apart from the ones taught in the university I don t know if I m in the right path to become a data scientist Is the physics degree useful for it Is it necessary to do a online course to become a data science My goal for the next year is learn python and sql start building my own projects Get a month internship in my final year of engineering And then finally get a job in the data analysis field Heyy brother it was such a relief to have found the deep wisdom you poured in through this video I'm extremely grateful to you Hi Ken jee what is the process and techniques to do data mining do I need to do separate course on data mining for datascience I'm stuck in this phase pls help me out this I agree this is a very neat and tidy repo very compact and well documented Only critism I have is that when I comes to using github in the real world the developer data scientist will need a good understanding of working with development staging and production branches which is not demonstrated here In addition when it comes to deploying models through cloud services such as aws it is more secure to have everything in its own repo Nice Bhai Do you find it more and more difficult to apply information directly from memory after being able to reference information quickly and reliably by Google etc Hey Ken do you have an email to reach out for more help Im new to data science but im having issues importing panda on spyder Error ModuleNotFoundError No module named 'panda' I uninstalled all python programs because I thought it couldnt find the panda location but its still giving me the same error I tried going on reddit but couldnt find a fix hopefully someone here can help thank you ''''import csv ''' import panda as pd data pd read csv 'plant csv' Subscribed to innoarchitech his stuff is awesome Thanks Ken for interviewing and bringing his work to light Awesome interview it was very interesting to listen to someone with such an interesting background You can basically start a podcast with so many interviews haha D Thanks Ken and Alex for such a great interview I had a question regarding the scope of Data Science in the Automotive Industry Can you help Here's the link to the AI Readiness article and model that I talk about in this video https www innoarchitech com blog artificial intelligence ai machine learning readiness Got a chance to watch the premier live and I really enjoyed the interview Thanks Alex and Ken Thanks for such an enlightened interview Ken Jee Love from Bangladesh Ken please make a playlist for this series Will be helpful for everyone Great video Ken This is insightful Hey great info currently working on a project and I have a few questions for you Hey Ken Can you make a video on a project where you predict the number of views you'll get in a week month for that video Also thank you for such amazing content Much needed couldn't agree anymore I think that kind of mindset must be had for all kind of goals that we want to achieve because some people usually blame the abstract way instead of choosing one and develop little by little It is very difficult to see your codes as the screen is so small please make sure the codes are visible to us Great video sir I want to know how exactly can we cite others work if we used their work in our projects I can't wait for this to premiere Ken's a great interviewer and his YouTube channel is awesome Yoooo it is my dream to work IndyCar or f Can't wait Hi Ken Great video and walk through One question why have you created dummy variables on the numeric features May God bless you for sharing this pertinent information Thank you professor Thank you Sir for sharing all the information I bought your class at Udemy it is an excellent Again special thanks to Alex for speaking with me His experience in IndyCar is so unique and I think everyone can learn quite a bit from his Journey

the full video although I'm sure it will be super helpful but I wanna tell you that you could consider reviewing portfolios of your latest emails because otherwise the person who sent you the portfolio won't get that much value since in months time he will have probably gotten a job It's just a suggestion I haven't sent you mine so I don't have personal interests Ken thank you very much for this video It's quite informative and you share a trove of resources I'm collecting resources for accompanying you in this journey as I am also very interested in developing my competencies and skills in data science Tx again You Saved myife Thank Youuu Sir How to get real world projects Hey Ken great video as usual I just thought I would mention if you add a ' smile' in the Amazon affiliates link it will take people to Amazon smile instead where Amazon pay an additional to a chosen charity for no extra cost So I got the job first then learned everything at the job Some people are just lucky I guess Hi Ken I just want to say you are such a good person Thank you for helping us aspiring data scientist Hey Ken really informative video thanks I'm a year old accountant looking to make the move into data science artificial intelligence I'm looking at doing a part time masters over years in Computer science Artificial intelligence from a good university in England My original degree was in economics so I have a bit of a statistical mathematical background If I build a portfolio of projects over the years what do you think my chances will be of landing a decent data science job once I graduate Thanks This is what I'm looking for thanks Hey bro when doing the stimulation using python does it predicts future who's gonna win I'm using excel right now and it's just the basic stats but it works I want to learn more do you have a series of videos on this Thanks How about super saiyan Congratulations Ken for this amazing videos series My huge Thank you for passing all the content in details and providing insights along a project I'm a big fan of you and you help me out a lot during my journey in the Data Science field Which tool is he using for the notes again This is helpful and enlightening In my certificate program we ve been using different tools and add ons to do all this THIS is much more work but a worthwhile endeavor It will take some time to get up to speed with github and my coding environment I was doing coding in a different arena years ago I hope it informs my ds coding environment Thank you Ken I'll adopt this approach the more That's a very helpful video Thank you Genius What do you think of using pre trained models and creating useful applications out of it Would that still count as a portfolio project Great stuff as always Hi Ken thank you for the interview Really useful for beginners like me But please avoid the background music It s distracting Free courses of data Science please Do you think there is merit in making resumes and cover letters using Latex I forgot to mention it in the video but Deepak should definitely add his hackathon experience to his resume Special thanks to Deepak for letting me review his work If you would like me to review your resume comment below and email your work to kenjee ds gmail com Videos Referenced watch these next Reviewing my own resume https www youtube com watch v lsXWVPzwZPk list

portfolios For a data analyst how important are hackathons when job hunting One day i will send you my profiles to review Really liked your work p Hey Ken How important certifications are Especially when you don't have much work experience Is it worth to get some to prove that you have the skill or it's not that necessary It was a lot of help Ken But I do have a question regarding resume Is it really IMPORTANT not to set Pic on our RESUME or we have to give pic in our RESUME Thanks Ken for reviewing my resume and projects I really appreciate you for doing this I will make the necessary updates Fantabulous challenge I'm in Hats off to your initiative Is it just me but i am seeing a lot of Indians Here How can i start learning programming from zero knowledge Can I have your contact details I have some doubts regarding masters in datascience Great work It helps to learn Data science in efficient way thanks for this work by the way can you say the documentation software which you are using it really looks cool An easy way to select text click where the text starts just place the cursor and click without holding scroll down to the end of text press and hold Shift then click where the text ends This is really tons of value can I know which is the note taking app which you are using Hi Ken I'm looking to transition into data science over the course of the next year or two if possible I have around years experience in digital media so there is somewhat of a narrative of data analysis that I can build on though that analysis was limited to digital media analytics platforms The job has given me an edge in terms of communication presentation building etc but that's where my advantages end My undergrad is in a non quantitative major sport management I have zero calculus at this time I spent the first years of my career in sales And I cannot afford to take an internship at any point throughout the remainder of my career I'm currently taking the Data Analysis nanodegree program with Udacity and getting a really good handle on the analytics toolkit The programming is coming easier than I expected From there I was thinking of self studying the math and doing the Udacity Data Science nanodegree to start to get the DS foundation I think I have a reasonable shot of moving into the analytics department at my current agency within the next year I can start to build a DS portfolio around that time as well With that context do you suggest I go masters boot camp certificate or continued self study after that Thanks Ken Got a clear idea of how to go about learning data science Following along with you on the daysofdata challenge Ohh yeah Kaggle is so great You said it all man From a noob that knows things here and there but has no idea how to do methodically approach this Thanks for this Awesome tips Thank you Will implement that on my channel Hi Ken great work I am also taking part in the amazing DaysOfData great initiative it's motivating me so much you have no idea I can't thank you enough for this What's the name of the app you're using in the video to take notes Thanks again Bro can u make more series like this This inspires a lot Hello Ken Is there any book that will help me learn which features I should use and which features to drop Thanks Ken for the awesome interview I love it learning a lot from your interviews I am also new and creating podcasts for data We also feature interesting industry leaders including folks from Spotify Uber and Petco That datascience site is pretty disingenuous in that a number of locations on its site it says Earn a data science degree at your own pace Earn your degree at a fraction of the cost There's no indication this site is accredited by any major recognized body or that their program is accepted as part of any actual degree program As comparison look at Statistics com where they do actually have accredited courses accepted towards a Data Science degree This video was great I have found some frustration from not understanding a topic but not looking for a different explanation For example I struggled to understand what a p value is and how it is useful to understand what the p value was I found a statistics textbook and read about it I still didn't understand and felt doomed to never understand p values Using your approach of looking for more resources I was able to get a better understanding of it It is a great idea to see a topic explained in different ways and by different sources Thank you for bringing this technique up Thanks for the video Ken Hi Ken I have been placed on Airbus a large aerospace company as a Data Scientist Will be on action from th September Thanks again to you and Data Professor Thanks Santosh This is dope bro Seeing you through the process is priceless Good job ty Since I am going some very though times right now having such a video is quite inspiring I wanted to save them for later but after what I learned in one of your previous video the best thing to do is to learn to emulate the best Not just the technical aspects but the habits and frame of mind required as well it is a pretty long interview but I'll digest it in several chunk today Daysofdata Happy Teacher's Day I learn both data science and English from you you have a fabulous pronunciation Thank you Very informative Will definitely use this approach to better understand other peoples's code and learn from their projects Also the tip to use documentations more is very valuable I think and will be doing this more from now on titan rtx now beaten by rtx for half the price lmfao you got ripped bro This is a great approach for people who don't have a lot of free time on their hands Another amazing video Ken Yeah I totally agree with this approach Whenever I start to work on something I try to learn the steps form another person's GitHub If I end with new function or new term I basically Google it out or search in stack And I found that if I do the same patterns of problems or project for times then I will have picked the patterns already It's amazing Ken Thanks for sharing I can't completely say that this is relatable to the video's topic but theres a website called invidio us where you are able to know the percentage of engagement rating family rating and also the wilson score of any video For any the data analysts out there I guess this can be a bit helpful to analyse your video's status Hey Ken just wanted to thank you for the great work you are doing Your channel has become by go to source of information for data science Hi Ken I just found your channel yesterday and I'm about to start learning data science This is so amazing thank you so much for making this Happy to follow along dude please try to improve audio quality You are a life saver Ken Thanks for the great insight Very useful video for beginners Happy Teacher's Day ken Thanks for sharing This was super helpful Just curious but why do you have clocks in your room Thanks for valuable tips Ken I am going to apply them on my DaysOfData journey and projects from now on Today is teacher's day in India so Happy teacher's day Ken So far your guidance through these videos is really helping me learn Data science Thank you As a data scientist I totally agree with this approach I also remember you saying anyone who is learning a new thing should seek theoretical knowledge and practice I also agree with that Keep up You are crushing it Amazing video Ken This is so insightful and helpful for my data science journey Always loves your video You are inspiration I work so hard learning this field Could you please help me in some of the topics I asked you on DaysOfData I am stucked and I really need some help Yessss you're the best Kenn This is really awesome st time I feel that I can actually break the iceberg to become a data scientist Thanks amen I appreciate you helping others learn faster and more efficiently I haven t seen all the resources but it ll be great you posting more resources to find codes other have built Looking forward to more This is amazing Thank you Thanks ken for being you Hi ken jee thanks for the video Just a quick question how much tensorflow and tableau needed for a data science job Bro I am a developer who is thinking to learn but while thinking got stuck much places Without knowing basis how need to move like that I thought Basics is completely theoretical Your way is awesome to learn tq so much I can use this in different field also I am doing the day challenge even got confusing You cleared my way which need to proceed Do well like these videos much Thank you so much Thank u sir for this video You clear all my doubts KenJee could talk about github repos that are great exemples of very well coded end to end data science projects I watch some kind of Data Science videos everyday so that is why you are in my recommendations a lot But this particular night I suddenly got really anxious that I wouldn t be good enough and your video popped up at the same moment and I clicked instantly because I wanted to feel some wave of calmness Does this come of as creepy Sorry about that But yeah I m calmer now eeps Hey Ken Hope you are doing well Thanks for an awesome video I recently started following your videos and the content is too good I had a query related to the career options I am an experienced professional working on SAP BW data warehousing solutions and lately I have developed interest in learning python to add to my skill set Since I am related to analytics I wanted to know how fine it would be for me to move into field of data science or data engineering Any suggestions is highly appreciated Btw thanks for accepting my connection request on LinkedIn Exactly what I was looking for Thank you man On one hand I really love your channel and I don t want it to become mainstream but on the other hand I really hope you will be rewarded for the effort quality that comes with these videos So here you get a comment for the algorithm D Starting my Data Science Bachelor soon your videos are like steroids for my motiviation Keep it up man Thanks KEN keep up the good work Practical Tips FOR THE WIN I am just a beginner and not an expert but I think beginners should take the first notebook by Pedro Marcelino with a pinch of salt There are some things I found very wrong in this notebook You don't always need to drop multicollinear variables most widely used model in Kaggle is XGBoost and it is immune to multicollinearity I think so are other random forest like models Dropping a variable because it has more than missing data is a bad idea This threshold is too much in my humble opinion There are more things which much more experience Data Scientists have pointed out in comments section I am not saying it's entirely useless but it is not great to follow it It has maximum votes but maybe it's just an outliar in Kaggle's dataset of Notebooks Great video Ken Your daily progress updates on discord motivates me even more Thank you for doing this I really love this initiative It really motivates me everyday to know that thousands of others are also learning the field I think reviewing notebooks is a great idea and I'll definitely do that as well in future days of data for now I'll focus on the theory first Let's build some habits Thank you you answered the exact question I had how to best go about this Thanks for watching everyone Keep up the great work with the DaysOfData Challenge More info on that here https www youtube com watch v uXLnbdHMf w ab channel KenJee Intro Why is it important to learn from other's code My approach Example Excellent tips This will be what I do Wow Best video I ve seen for learning date science analysis This is a highly valuable and useful video Thanks a ton Ken Great video Ken Learning from other people's code is a great way to learn Another great way to learn for me is code reviewing where for example some of my colleague or students would send over their code as a Jupyter notebook where I would go over the code figure out how the ML model workflow could be improved could be faster could add some areas of novelty etc such that the resulting research paper would have a chance for publication in a scientific journal Afterwards I would have discussion with the person who wrote the code and together we can learn from one another on the rationale for choosing a specific approach and whether some component could be adjusted to provide better performance new areas of novelty etc On another note Amazing video editing pattern interrupts also noticed that you're using Notion as placeholders for the code great tips Wow I've just noticed how long this comment has become Hi I have completed masters in Statistics and Learn Data Science I am curious about job opportunity's in you country And i want to learn more knowledge from you Please help me Hope you replay to this when you see I have already undertaken Coursera's IBM data science professional certificate and about to finish it this week As a beginner I learnt a lot but feel there is still a long way to go Do you think this certificate and projects of my own will help me fetch a job in this field I would really appreciate if you reply ofcos he didnt look good I love hands on learning I thought that I hate this field but you help me to realize how much I still love this field and I quit my meaningless and bad job to be better and learn more because that job didn't make me a better data scientist You even inspire me to write articles thank you so much thanks man This is helping me unblock things in my head and allows me to keep my own personal daysofdata alive Plus I already wanted to check the very notebook you're showing there since I am doing a lot of this uncooperative House regression thingy It also an important lesson since so far I wanted to take pride into trying to build my own model alone from scratch without external help well I guess I came as far as I could with this method which your video is helping me understand I think this is actually an incredible idea You are such an inspiration to us Thanks for motivating us Bro This is top Maybe you have already said it and I'm mistaken but I haven't been able to find it in your videos What kind of projects would you recommend for getting a data ANALYST job I've seen the data scientist recommendations but I suppose they are not the same I would really appreciate it although I know you are busy Thank you for everything Ha missed out on a bunch of videos and this daysofdata challenge due to holiday Is it too late to join in daysofdata Love your content Willing to start the DaysofData Kudos Hi Ken Jee could you please help me mitigate this progress data is scrapping without any error but couldn't find the data and data is not downloading in the folder and progress remains the same through out scrapping it does show X out failed in between scrapping would really appreciate if some one can assist There is no error as well Soo hours a day days a week for three years that was too much Do you have any links to flaskwrapper samples Hi Mr Ken I enjoyed watching this video Great advise Can you give me ideas about the latest application of ML that can be considered as project in my IT course Thanks Thanks for sharing this interview with us Ken Keep it up This was super insightful to me as a FAANG contractor haha You guys reminded me to have my resume tell my journey Great Idea I started Sept st I recommend keeping track of progress and time in a spreadsheet share with friends to stay accountable and on track I started learning Python language four days ago I found your videos by coincidence on you tube I'm really enjoying the content you're offering us thanks a lot and keep going I love how ken replies to every comment Kudos Man Can a beginner join I am interested in data science in plant breeding Actually you can spell check in illustrator I use illustrator myself btw and there is spell check Go to Edit Check Spelling I found the MEAP Maths for Programmers with Python examples very rewarding to getting into using algorithms It avoids the typical pitfall whereby a maths book starts almost condescendingly slow then out of nowhere introduces formulas as if you should know them innately from birth Thank you Ken I ve been digging through your channel lately and it s great I graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering but I really want to go into the data science space Would you suggest getting a masters Hi I am new to Data Science I have a Civil Engineering Degree and a MBA I also understand how to develop algorithms with my knowledge in C and C unfortunately this was over yrs ago I have maintained the knowledge to develop algorithms not so much the language I was taught to visual the problem and find what are constants and what will be the variables I had also used Matlab in college to write a code to solve triple integrals which was far easier to do than solving it by hand I also understand statistics and have years of engineering experience I have decided to start with learning Python I am going the self taught method Is there some good resources you can recommend textbooks free webinars professional societies communities and methods to building a portfolio Thank you for sharing your advice Great video But I wish you mentioned some edx and coursera courses even Interesting journey It's really a great interview Ken Thanks for sharing with us When you say you will start Kaggle projects which projects in particular will you be attempting Is data science mainly used to do evil such as face recognition and surveillance in communist China I've just completed first and second stage working on C and I'm presently doing research for next stage of study Hey there Thanks for such a great content But I still have a few questions If I have opportunity to choose between Data Science and Computer science major then which one will be better Even for ML Engineer jobs And do you like to advice me on working destinations for data scientist employees among Z rich US Australia Amazing interview Tina really is a motivating force as well it's just amazing to see how people even from non cs backgrounds make a transition into software engineering or in this case even data science Thank you for the helpful content All set ready Hey Ken thanks for sharing your experiences please can you get me to product manager or senior product manager for meet p lease ken Holding a bachelor degree in petroleum engineering but in the past few months i grew passion in DS Equipped with intermediate python skill self taught might get a DS job someday Kindly advise whether i should get a degree in computing is it necessary to get a degree to land a job in these field I like the way you manage the interview it goes smoothly I appreciate what you are doing to the community you may have impacted many lives God bless you Sure why not Ill join ya Ken could PM since I am getting an MSBA and I seeking supplemental material such as the course in your over video Let me know if this possible thanks Hey man great insight I'm a brand new student and years away from getting my batchelor in data science at city tech my only fear is that I won't get a job because my school is not prestigious Is this a real issue Finaly a female data scientist Yes girls learn to code Hey Ken Thanks for creating Such Awesome Contents I am really inspired by You and I am too thinking to create my Channel I wanted to Ask That How to get project Ideas for programming in Python or any other Lang Data Science and Python in Specific Please Try Creating a Video on it if U think This Is Something Worth to Share with Others Too Challenge accepted My OCD really wants to synchronize the minute hands on those clocks LOL great insights as always Ken did the dayofdara app work for you my two favorite data science youtubers in one video It's abundantly clear who I'll have to thank when I land a job someday I have also just finished masters in CS Only this lockdown i decided to learn DS So relatable Thanks ken and Tina Learnee alot So what were her projects that had value to others I would rather listen to this without background music It's so relaxing that it makes me sleep Sir I am

Incredible insights from this interview Hey could I email you about this I would really like your guidance I've done some python basic programming numpy pandas basic probs and stats pdf cdf distributions I started the Titanic problem on kaggle and I'm working my way towards a solution Is this a good way to study Look for problems and then Google read your way towards a working solution I tend to stick to traditional ways of studying do all the theory at once and then get to problem solving Please please please respond with your thoughts evilc github io just created yesterday curl s https course fast ai setup colab bash when i run this cell getting some error bash line syntax error near unexpected token newline' bash line DOCTYPE html Hey I've watched your previous videos and really did learn a lot Keep up the good work waiting for your next video You are my man Let's built a team and predict the next Champions League winner What if I don't have a twitter account how can i follow you along I am taking ds bootcamp from datascience Do you think there is any value to a B S of Data Analytics Hey Question I'm going to be graduating with a Bachelors Degree in CS this Spring but I would love to pivot into Data Science particularly in the sports field Do I need a masters or something else thanks Hey man where do you get your shirts Hello am a beginner in machine learning I want to work on a sales forecasting project Is there any way you can help me with tutorial videos Thank you Good luck I was a data scientist before it was even a job title So I didn't start with a plan at all but here's how it sort of just happened BS Math loved linear algebra Taught school for a few years Ugh MS Statistics w nd concentration in Information Systems Mgmt multivariate time series analysis machine learning database theory Entry level Tech support and QA analyst for a popular and pricey stats software Mastered SAS SPSS R APL similar to Numpy learned to program design test cases for statistical graphics routines Mortgage data analyst at Fannie Mae Mostly SAS preparing presentations for execs Kind of boring except for learning SAS so I quit after mos By then it was very easy to change jobs with the skills and network of colleagues I had amassed Software Engineer NASA think tank Awesome job rocket science Brilliant mentors UNIX Statistician IRS IT Dept Mastered Excel Oracle Sql Later mastered MS SQL Crystal Reports Power BI for independent consulting contracts Yay no more jobs And I never accepted a management position because I prefer numbers to people Recently I retired but I've learned Python data science packages just for fun and now I use Jupyter inside of VScode on Linux and enjoy keeping up even tho I don't work at all I'll be watching to see how it goes for you Can you elaborate a bit more about this venture funded ML predictor Around If you ever want to review my second attempt at a regression it is in a gist here My first one which was huge was just embarrassing This one at least gives better results But I m not overconfident that everything I star is correct hope so https gist github com lewiuberg b c ede c e ea dca e e c Hey what are the books mentioned around by the speaker and Ken Responding to questions from the comments at the end of the video definitely sounds like a good idea to me thanks for the great videos really useful content i love you I am just finished computer engineering and i am thinking of entering into data science I want to apply for an online masters degree What do you think Thank you ken Jee sir what are the things should i learn to become a data scientist thanks This is a great initiative Ken Gonna be a part of this and hoping that my slacking journey to mastering data science will become more efficient Thanks Ken for another great video I agree with you Ken Darwin's GitHub is very well structured folder wise content wise and format wise The plots are visually appealing The drop down button is also an awesome feature I also haven't used that yet Very interesting The amount of help you are providing is immense Please keep uploading these type of videos specially Thank you so much Hey Ken I've a question Since I saw your video where you built a project from scratch and I discovered pd apply I feel that I've been abusing it I've read more about the function and sometimes another implementations are faster When do you decided to not use pd apply and use other methods Love your videos I'm happy to participate in your DaysOfData initiative Lets Reboot and Finish what we have started Thanks a Zillion Ken Jee Thanks for accepting my invitation on LinkedIn Can you please review my profile as well Thank you for your Video I'm following you and also willing to participate in your DaysOfData initiative DDDD I was really excited to hear that you wanted to start all over again because my Data Science Journey will begin now Thank you very much for your inspiring videos And good luck on your new data science journey Wow Great GitHub profile motivating to create such one I'll try this Seems fun Thanks for sharing keep up the great work What do you mean by benchmarking your model Great video New personal goal submit a profile to Ken in months Currently have an empty github Such an amazing interview I m an absolute beginner currently focusing on Andrew Ng Machine learning theory videos and then i ll jump into the kaggle Hey Ken Would you consider a BA in Psych and an MS in Human Computer Interaction enough of a formal education to learn on my own and land a job Please tell what are u reading iLL also start from there Hi Ken Loving this idea I actually just started the data analyst in python pathway on dataquest a couple days ago after realizing I needed to up my skills if I really wanted to become involved with data analytics science in the future so perfect timing This is an amazing initiative and although I don't have twitter I will be following along on your other socials linkedin YT trying to connect with fellow data lovers Looking to follow your journey I ve just started a post grad course on Data Science and been watching your vids for a lot of help and resources Thanks man Good timing that you re doing this hey ken quick question When describing ones skills with ML on the resume is it better to name specific models or more general techniques i e Skills Machine Learning linear regression svm PCA etc vs Skills Machine Learning Regression Classification Dimensionality Reduction etc Thanks for all the videos you put out and thanks for reading Love you channel I m in grad school MS Data Science coming from a GIS background and your channel was my inspiration My goal is to break into sports analytics and I would love to combine spatial data analysis with sports analytics Responding to good questions at the end is great for everyone who can learn from the questions they didn t even think of Definitely did enjoy the linkedin part Congratulations to Darwin very good portfolio I also browsed it and got very surprised https github com darwin a It's good to know that he got his first job in DS months ago My portfolio is also a bit different because I recorded some videos of the last projects I'm in So excited for this Thank you so much Ken I'm new to Data Science and I appreciate this very much Thanks bro I feel that incorporating good questions into videos would be good That way people dont ask the same question over and over again Also good questions wont get lost as videos get older Hi I have learned some basics of scikit learn and machine learning is there any specific source you would recommend for learning more of data handling and preprocessing Thanks Hi ken do you think a github portfolio is better than a personal website that contains all your information and projects Or should I do both Thank you Hi Ken Thank you for this video I am new to your channel For past month or so I have been going through your videos to learn more about data science and how to break in to this field I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and have worked as Business Intelligence Developer for past few years I am hoping to make it to data science field I have been taking some free courses that you have suggested over the past month brushed up on my stats finished two of the Kaggle courses more in progress etc I really want to thank you for taking the time to provide guidance to those of us who are new to data science field I also want to thank you for pushing people like me to break out of their shell and go public I am currently an Electrical Engineer and I always felt that my strongest side was in programming and mathematics I always struggled with the hardware side of EE and was looking to change into another major What are your opinions on a switch to DS I have taken Statistics before and enjoyed the class as a tid bit Wow I actually haven't seen this one repo multiple projects folders approach so far that's a pretty neat idea Also it would be great if you answer comments at the end of the video given that there are relevant questions of course I think that would put even more information into your already very informative videos Speaking of questions Here's one So I watched your Udemy course and how you talked about reaching out to recruiters or just in general experienced people and how you should try to schedule a call within a specific timeframe You also said it's always a good idea to try and give something back so to offer to the other person some sort of help My question would be what type of help can someone offer when they are a student or just in general less experienced Oh and I'm excited for the days of data science Personally I'll probably go for days of machine learning engineering haha Towards a being better data scientist Take one question and a minute segment on it would be cool at the end of the video Even throw in an example Cheers Again special thanks to Darwin for submitting his gitub profile If you would like to have your projects resumes portfolios or linkedin reviewed for a video please comment below and send me an email at kenjee ds gmail com Discord for DaysOfData https discord gg VXSUJYJ I know it's outdoor but three clocks on the wall It's a productivity matter or it's just a decor Namasthe Ken Jee This is Shiva from India I'm a mechanical Engineering graduate from Lovely professional University with a CGPA grade I'm currently learning IBM Data science Professional certificate and planning to start Python programming from Univ Of Michigan both on Coursera MY GOAL By the end of Jan I should be working as a Data scientist I want to celebrate my birthday as a data scientist Would you please guide me through this journey Hi Ken what would you suggest for variable engineering EDA and data visualization Welding etc great idea I m super interested Hello Ken I want to thank you for all the great videos you provide that really help us the ones that are interested in entering the field of data science I saw a video of yours where you suggested that for landing a job in the field it's good to have like projects using regression classification clustering and DL or NLP My question is after I saw the great work Darwin did is it enough to just focus on like projects or that are is in our field of interest is That maybe the number of projects doesn't matter but the quality and the way you present them do Thank you Go ahead with responding comments Love this approach in reviewing very honest and straightforward Before this video I thought creating more and more repos would actually be a great show off in front of employers but now I think that I really have to work on my GitHub and organize it Thanks for this video brother I think that would be a good idea I asked a q on your last video so I'm excited to connect That's the best way to respond to our questions please Thanks Ken Jee I'm excited Thanks bro Do you have a goodreads profile This series is going great Thanks Ken Very cool idea Ken Good luck and thanks as always for continuing to inspire and help grow the DS community Wow This is so good I'm going to join you Excited for this DaysOfData How to use different Hugo theme Like academia etc I don't want to use anake theme Awesome content Subscribed What keyboard is that Ya videos on the way Thanks Hi I am a beginner Could you please tell me how to check if my approach to a particular competition problem is correct or not Edit maybe just ignoring the sci kit info for now I think I'm in a position where I actually need to learn a lot and I am curious about R specific resources I just started a new job entry level at a startup and I only know R I'm currently building out pipelines and other processes and I wanted to know if you had any resources that would be helpful for the days Lets go How to follow if not on Twitter I really appreciate you doing this I am a Physician but data is the future Thank Following you commander Is it on youtube only If so I'll love it After watching this conversation and doing some careful consideration including trying Datacamp vs Dataquest I ended up subscribing to a month of Dataquest and am really happy a week in The context was that even though I had done a self instruction path of working on projects including for my current clients I realized there were major holes in my fundamentals on both Python and R So even though I currently have projects I do every day using Pandas R and SQL working in combination for real world results I was doing things like Leetcode and realizing my Python basics were really shaky Based on this interview in your video and your feedback about value of looking for free resources vs paying to have it all in one place organized well and with a good teaching tool I opted to try this for a month I was immediately paid back with learning almost all of the exact things I had questions about or was missing in my current knowledge I was also very impressed with the curriculum on Dataquest and feel it is worth the monthly payments right now to very quickly acquire a base standard of data science knowledge that is in some ways with current standard practices and knowledge Given your days of data science challenge coming up I think it was fortunate timing for my own ongoing efforts to pivot to this field from my current area of expertise online programmatic ad ops Interviews like this really do provide a lot of value for those of us looking for answers and realistic and honest appraisals of solutions Thanks again Great initiative I'll be following along Just started with Kaggle micro courses I'll join the challenge Accountability is helpful when learning online Tomorrow's tasks include setting goals creating a calendar roadmap and signing up for twitter I'm interested to see the journey from different perspectives Hey Ken Thanks for the tips I m steadily habituating many of these practices and with greater intention after watching the video Question what are you using that small whiteboard on your desk for I have a similar one that I m trying to determine a purpose for Hi Ken I am an Entrepreneur in manufacturing and holds a masters degree in manufacturing as well Due to pandemic I had to close my business and am looking for opportunities in data science I have completed few courses including the zero to mastery course by Daniel bourke which helped me create a lot of interest in this field I am hoping to relate data science with manufacturing Can you advise me about the same Is it possible to find a job in data science as I am from a different educational background I too feel stuck which is why I also will be participating in daysofdata Time to buckle down and get focused for September Do all data scientists work from home Daysofdata I am in Let's play data Thank you You are a gem Love from India Thank you for the great book advices in this too I would really like to know if you have some more books you would recommend to data scientists or people studying Data Science Or overall books you like in this subject I am looking forward to participate in this learning trip I need this process so bad Thank you Hi Ken I was wondering where I could find the data for the latest season and before as well I love your videos and used the nba api but it doesn't seem to have a suitable endpoint If you have any idea that would be so helpful thanks I've been planning to kickstart my DS Journey And here I have finalized the date Will be joining you on the journey come Sept This is awesome Thanks for sharing Wow l am on board for this I really don't like the number However I'm a huge fan of the channel and will follow along Thanks for this Hope I can make myself accountable too See you soon Hey Ken A question Is learning Google Data Studios would be useful to a Data Science person Can't wait to join the trend daysofdata Is there a use for people with social science degrees in data science What's your idea on that Man why do you have clocks of the same design all telling the different time Lets start and do this DaysofData That's great will join you on the journey was planning to start from Sept will keep updating on Twitter following you on daily updates thanks a lot for this man Let us taking the competition on Kaggle Hi Ken I have seen that the Practical Statistics for Data Scientists book is based on R Isn't it confusing if you want to focus on Python or you just want to get the statistics part Thanks I'll definitely be getting involved in this Thanks Ken Count me in Kanjee Let me follow u on twitter But I do not have subscription I do have datacamp Is it fine I already started learning Python from scratch again yesterday I guess I'm reading your mind It's written by Abhishek Thakur who I had on the channel a couple days ago actually That's badass Ken is the one who always shows others light and make people have faith Wow great initiative Thanks Ken Discord or slack channel Let's go DaysofData super excited and I'll be trying my best to follow along Hii Ken Jee Me being at start of Data Science Journey can definitely say that this journey with u will help us people like me Definitely will join u along Thanks a lot I just obtained my Bachelor's in Business Management and became interested in Data Science a few months ago I m taking classes to pursue a second Bachelor s in Computer Science and will be cool to follow you along with your restart on Data Science I also purchased the Data Science program because of your recommendation Ken Jee I am just starting out on the data science path and would try to make the best out of this initiative You definitely make an intimidating subject easy to follow Thank you for your efforts Mad respect for doing this I feel like you're the type of person who values being accountable to yourself Good initiative Ken I can't wait to start For a long time I was thinking about building up my project portfolio but I was lacking a regular structure With this initiative I will probably get some structure and also get motivated to follow it Thanks for starting it all over again Feature Selection Loops and Matplotlib Thanks for your videos they def help a lot of ppl including me I m unsure on majoring in data science or computer science I really want to follow on this initiative but have a question I have already taken the Kaggle micro courses Python Pandas Data Visualization and Intro to Machine Learning Is that okay if I already have somewhat of a headstart I am starting to learn now some machine learning but with a different book It is from O'Reilly and called Introduction to Machine Learning with Python another book I can recommend and a bit tight on buying new books Would that be ok This is so great I really need to brush up and get motivated Really excited about this I love this Ken this is so thoughtful of you Would be starting with you Thanks for the recommendations Ken I really appreciate it I want to dive into machine learning but my math and statistics knowledge are not good enough yet Do you think the book Think Stats is a good book to learn statistics basics After learning statistics the book Hands On Machine Learning is good for beginners Thank you for this I m want to learn Data Science but the boot camp is too expensive for me right now K I m in a free camp for software engineering so I m finally starting to learn tech I hope next year with this and Coursea hopefully I can make my break in data science There aren t a lot of black people in the field it seems so I m nervous Joining as well I am ready literally sponsored by data lmao aint trusting This video is the essence of don't let perfect be the enemy of good hi i graduate in civil engineering and i want to work with data science I've been learning for months and planning my next step Do you think i should do another graduation or just some especialization on the field Looking forward to statistics part You inspired me to take a peek at Abhishek's book Seemed legit Purchased Thank you Ken for these great resources You inspired me to start my data science journey fastai also launched new free course recently which is a great resource to learn deep learning really appreciate the back to basics reset thanks Ken looking forward i am so fucking pumped dude I bought the data science complete bootcamp on udemy Would that work along with your initiative Hi Ken Thank you so much you came from havean for me I started learning just around a month ago Im lost for me as an electrical engineer Industrial oil gas data science like different planet my mathematical background is very strong but coding experience is absolute zero I found myself really taken by data science For now i focus only on Python we will see the rest after that check out freecodecamp org they have a very great program with free certificate their YouTube videos made by university doctors Great Job Hero Believe me Im cheering for you man like you made a triple points with a big dunk Ken Jee hoo hoo Ken Jee hoo hoo Ken Jee hoo hoo Great initiative Would there be a slack or discord channel where people who want to follow you on this journey can update For anyone thinking about learning the skills for a data science career or even as a personal hobby Johns Hopkins University created a pay what you want training series of courses targeting beginners You do not have to be a complete novice to benefit from these courses get your feet wet or whet your appetite whichever analogy you prefer https leanpub com universities set jhu cloud based data science Hello Ken I think this is a really positive move Refreshing your knowledge is always something beneficial and I think this will be great both for you and of course for your audience Since I also wanted to widen my horizon for a bit now I'll try to take out that bit of time out of my day and learn as well I don't acutally use Twitter but I'll just keep track regardless Happy learning Commenting before the vid ends just to address the wink at That was a nice touch lol This is awesome I'm really glad that you are doing this Hey Ken What about setting up a discord server so the community can better help each other and communicate Thanks a lot for this man Keep it up Hi Ken could you post your daily work on LinkedIn as well besides Twitter daysofdata thats a fantastic idea Ken I was using Daniel Bourke's day learning strategy which worked so well for me As a beginner this strategy helped me to not waste time getting overwhelmed by the vast areas of topics to learn in data science I just picked some basic projects to focus and learn using reverse engineering for days and it was a fruitful endeavor Looking forward to learn with you man It's rare people accept the downsides publically Good wishes Ken Jee Hey Ken Thanks a lot for taking this initiative I'll definitely join you up Just wanted to make a suggestion here It'll be great if you can make a whatsapp group by the end of this course so that we can have a community of people on similar stag in their data science journey and they can colobrate from there and take it forward by doing more projects Again thanks for doing this Really excited Hey ken I dont have twitter Do you have a discord group where we can collaborate as a community share progress learn and motivate each other Bro From Where Should I Start Software Development skills ie Excelling Python or From Mathematics or Directly Jump on To Data Science Concepts Recently it has been over a Month or two fro me Programming in Python and I think I am at SOMEWHAT intermediate Level Please Suggest Me I think one of the biggest obstacles of learning python is actually practicing the syntax and memorizing the many different functions needed to code Any websites you re using to practice the syntax functions and solving given problems that are common when using python Thanks a lot sir for doing so much for us You are the best let's go I can't thank you enough for this man I will be honest I didn't have a friend to prepare for Data Science with and I was looking desperately for someone and who he turned out to be it was Ken Jee The same person from whom I understood what Data Science basically is And I owe you big time man Thank you thank you so much I will surely keep you updated on my progress Thank you once again my man Thank you Hi Ken This initiative is amazing Are you going to upload videos during the days Or just sharing the process through your Twitter account I am up Thanks ken for sharing excited to start the daysofData one question from you WHY THERE ARE THREE CLOCKS ON THE WALL JUST CURIOUS TO KNOW OR IT'S JUST FOR A SHOWCASE that wink at should be the wink of the month Will you also upload YouTube videos on what you are learning I was feeling stuck in my learning so this video is an excellent incentive to move forward with my projects Hey man really appreciate the videos I have a question where can I find projects for a data analyst portfolio everywhere I go I just see data science projects and no data analysts analytics thanks The DaysofData learning relearning initiative comes at the ideal time I start a geospatial data analytics graduate level program after Labour Day Twitter why not LinkedIn Let s do this I'll be following Thank you The Hands On ML with Keras Tensorflow is indeed really good I am enjoying it as well Talk about getting you to do stuff the book doesn't lead with the data processing but goes straight to the analysis It was a deliberate move by the author to get your interest before talking about some of the other necessities Hello Ken looking forward to learning data science with you Hi Ken this is so exciting for me Really looking forward to this initiative and I just wanted to ask why twitter and not Linkedin for posting the daily updates DaysOfData Sir Please Improve some lighting the light in video looks very dull I really don't need to start over the first time is enough haha please do the same in Instagram Unofficial discord server https discord gg MCczub Do reply with an official one if that exists but for now this will do I am excited and looking for that Ken Jee what are basic kaggle projects to do and learn Discord will be great for this What a irony ken sir Every time I wanted anything you made a video on it and I get solution of my problems Excited to join this with you Hopefully days becomes days p Waiting for this from a Long time Can you create a video comparing data science or fields of DS and Actuary Hi Ken I actually worked on building a simple Youtube Video categorization model using just the title and description When I plotted those text metadata using a T SNE plot I could see that videos from the same category where not compressed together rather they were scattered around forming occasional blobs of different category videos clustered together So I wanted to know that how does Youtube actually categorize its videos because 'title description' doesnt seem to be very specific Link https github com siddharth web scraping classification blob master EDA YT ipynb Thanks for always making amazing content thank you for all the videos Can you share any ideas and resources about cricket analysis using R Thanks Soo excited Can you add linear algebra as well It is taught in Applied ai course and I'm searching for resources to learn it and haven't found anyone yet This video was a huge shot of motivation I've been using the past couple of months to begin my own journey towards working in the Data Analytics field since losing my job to COVID This interview was extremely helpful in reinforcing some of the things I was already doing as well as making me aware of the things I wasn't Congratulations to Ray on his success in breaking into the Data Analytics field and thank you to Ken for providing such helpful content in this area Finally days of data is here I have started to upload dataset on kaggle https www kaggle com akhandpratap pm narendra modi tweets during pandemic Hi Ken great content as usual Thank you so much it helps me a lot Hello Ken great to see this Do we have any prerequisites for this serie I have taken a Stats class a Intro to Datascience class and have some experience with R is it enough to follow along Thank you Ken I'm getting the follwing error 'IMapUnorderedIterator' object has no attribute Please advise Woo Excited to follow along on this one Revising the basics will never be a bad idea Let's do this want to start data science in the right path show us ken Really looking forward to this I hope you can also touch upon how important it is to learn about deployment pipelines and if so how we should go about it I'm so excited for this patiently waiting Just the thing I wanted Speaking of which related to my comment below a message for the followers of Ken jee How about meeting on a regular basis on Kaggle and talking about our progresses And of course help each other out share notes and even better work together on a project once we're good enough one of these days PS a discord chat with voice might also be useful and I am willing to help establish it just in case I am already in the process of taking not just the habits of doing ML every day that's a requirement I think when you're beginning and new in the field but als recently I started using my Bullet Journal to record my investment and progress into the field And since I am still trying to sort out a few things both in tracking my progress and trying to establish a clearer road map seeing this on my computer this morning came as an incredibly great blessing thank you Now question Could you and us the rest of your community also have some discussion on say Kaggle on regular basis I feel like that for newcomers like me it would help navigate the kaggle maelstrom and be less intimidated as well as having a clearer road map As for you it would help you both reexamine your fundemantals through teaching as well as helping you establish yourself as a good proficient teacher that has both passion for the field and is teaching it with the best of intentions And I assume when we your followers and students start becoming proficient and say 'Ken Jee was instrumental in this' well I am really hoping this will open doors for you the best ones just saying Dear I am starting with you as well super excited lets rock it ken Thanks for this amazing initiative I would love to join so much to learn let me stock up on the books you suggested Really excited for this Can't wait longer Why is Ken Jee playing dota for days Jokes aside This is awesome The value you give to the Data Science community is massive Thank you very much Epic much awaited one So excited for this Please guide us to the right path Ken Senpai Wow I'm just starting too I'd love to join you on this I'm currently working through the HarvardX cert John Hopkin's lined up afterwards I'll squeeze in your courses too as appropriate Wow really excited for this journey DaysOfData DaysOfData Let's do this Oh man Looking forward to it May i ask you which IDE you use to run python codes or for data science works Thank you so much ken looking forward to it how long do you plan on grinding each day Hi Ken really enjoy your video I have been following your tips Its pretty good and promising Favourite video is How I would learn data science if I had to start over Can't wait for today's video Hi Ken I have prior experience in analysis on excel However I consider myself as the beginner I recently acquire the knowledge of Python hope it will help me understand more efficiently Looking forward to it Thanks sweet mother of all that is good and pure Hello Ken could you also mention the important topics to learn sequence wise like i am really confused about embeddings and models like BERT GLOVE etc it would really help if you could explained where they will be used with few example in the video Thanks Eagerly Waiting Hey Ken Can beginners follow along in DaysofData as well I'm really new to the field of data science I'm very excited to start the DaysOfData initiative on September You can follow along with me and also participate on twitter https twitter com KenJee DS Discord Server https discord gg VXSUJYJ Resources I'm using Videos I Referenced Kaggle https www kaggle com Data Science off Monthly https

was certainly enlightening listening to the amazing discussion lots of practical tips Why is it inclusive for loc but exclusive for iloc for the end of the range I got confused for a while there thinking that I missed something lol really great content Ken I just started getting into data science and your videos helped me a lot thanks a lot man Much needed Does the course contain end to end projects Or it's just on how to build your portfolio and how to behave in a data science interview and what should you expect Great guide and motivation for kagglers Don't get disappointed with the low scores and never give up Hey Ken would you say knowing Algorithms is important for becoming a data scientist I love deep learning and analytics but heavy CS topics like Algorithms or Data Structures bore me to death i just found out kaggle existed here thanks alot ken Ken I'm looking forward for the course related to sports analytics Thanks for all the effort you put in Ken It takes a lot of effort and time in making these videos which will help you and as well as the community I had enormous interest towards sports and I do want to contribute to the field However I came across your videos and i really like the way those videos were organised Keep your good work mate Hello ken jee i am one of your old subscriber i just wanted to tell you that if you could make a video where you will take an interview of any fresher data scientist like a proper interview So please make such video If anyone agrees plz give a like to let him know Hey Ken thanks for the great content Have you ever thought about uploading episodes like this as Podcast too I think w o any additional effort many would benefit from this because Youtube Go is not really functional Hey guys I new to all this and I need it for my IT class Sh mabye there is someone who could help me To begin with I can't even install the module and I have no idea why I've searched and tried a bit but not found a solution yet Second I basically need all this turns around so I need the program to show me players in a range around after I search for a certain stat If anyone know how to help me or can tell my where to find help I would be really grateful Everyone have a nice day I'm about to start my masters in Data science but I'm still afraid of kaggle You have mentioned starting with python or R but how important is SQL Do you think learning SQL would be good for someone just learning to code I have an undergraduate degree in finance and I am considering entering the data science field The local university offers a post baccalaureate certificate in data analytics I would only need to take a few courses to complete the certificate such as data mining database management and big data management Do you think this is a good way to start in data analytics The courses I complete for the certificate would also count towards a master's in data analytics Getting an error when doing hugo server failed to extract shortcode template for shortcode form contact not found Any help would be appreciated Thanks Hey Ken Is programming really important I m not really good at programming Great video Have you tried working with some linux distribution What use C as my programming language is it fine or will it be useless Excellent this is very helpful Hi Ken Jee thank you for this vid informative video couldn't find elsewhere I wanna become a Political Analyst where Sentimental Analysis is more used rather than statistics Can you help me direct how can I achieve that I am Pol science student with foundational knowledge in Python and still learning it Thank you Ken this interview motivates me work very had data science with kaggle O my god This videos is just make me wanna learn more and click more damn thank you man Lots of love You said Everything Hello Ken I am in a very fortunate spot where I have the option to attain an accelerated masters degree completely free It is a year program Co Terminal With that being said I am going to be attending Illinois ITech and would love to know your thoughts on attaining an accelerated masters in Computer science or Data Science The pros and cons between the two I am acquiring a bachelors in Computer science and am wondering if it would be more beneficial to acquire the data science degree with the Internship opportunities down town Chicago or master in CS I am intrigued in both computer science and data science but I lean towards mastering in data because I feel like a bachelors in CS is already enough But some people have said that a masters in CS is viewed as more valuable respectable and versatile Anyways your expert opinion would be great please Thanks for sharing i found your channel months ago and your video's have definitely improved Awesome conversation guys All the tips around kaggle are pretty useful Again just for the algorithms Awesome interview Could you recommend some book s that cover the probablity and statistics needed for data science Thanks Completely agreed However would this be a step after you get proficient with coding in python and stats machine learning algorithms for coding interviews Where can I get Andrew Wang's Course Really appreciate the content and the interviews you're putting out This honestly helps a lot tweaking my own path i think it's motivational too since this field is wayyy more complex and the kaggle community has grown a lot too Thankyou I am just starting to do the beginner competition that you told about Another amazing video Thank you ken This is GOLD Thanks for the amazing content Nice Video Ken Thanks This video is such a motivational to become active on Kaggle Hi ken I have only one internship related to Data science but I also worked in a Newsagent a hostel and I taught English as a voluntary project Do you think I should mention them as well Or just compensate my lack of experience with more projects and mention that one internship Thank you for your time I really respect you for answering most if not all of the comments on your videos A month I am also starting my kaggle journey with titanic dataset and already spent days into it I was just thinking about for how many days I am gonna do this I thought he was gonna say a week at most I hope this interview inspires you to get started on kaggle Again special thanks to Abhishek

leader Love this interview Ken This video has motivated me to be more active and compete more on Kaggle Amazing With every interview you just surprise me more and more It is definitely relieving to hear that even people like him sometimes struggle with the data science ecosystem Just goes to show that everyone struggles but it's still possible to come out succesfully or even exactly because of the struggle Great content There are nuggets of serious gold in here Great vid ken This video is very informative for a kaggle beginner like me Thanks for the video Ken Your videos help a lot Keep it going Ken Amazing content as always Love your content Ken much love from South Africa First view of my favourite youtubers coming together Entered stage Wow he really does have a very impressive resume The level of detail he put into his projects is just insane especially for someone who even has a different background I think it would be great to see Tina and Danny review projects as well that would probably give them more attention on this platform as well Name it 'Model Overfit' because with this power it's very tempting to make a mistake and overfit the model Dude you are terrible in explaining things in a pedagogical what Impossible to follow your quick scrolling I am a commerce student having background in financial management and accounts I was looking forward to doing something that would integrate finance and data analytics should I start with python or r or what should be ur suggestion thanks in advance Really helpful Thanks Hey Ken I was not sure if you saw the response I made on your scraping glassdoor video But here is the code that scrapes the titles of glass door The main advantages are that it is more efficient code wise and it is much faster then selenium I also did this in beautiful soup which Is not a super scalable library but it illustrates the power of scraping tools If you want to scale on a larger level I recommend learning scrapy Additionally there is also a tool available that lets you select the exact css element of a web page I will re link it again Anyways here is the code that scrapes the job titles for glassdoor from bs import BeautifulSoup from urllib request import urlopen Request import pandas as pd import random import pickle headers User Agent Mozilla Windows NT AppleWebKit KHTML like Gecko Chrome Safari website https www glassdoor com Job data scientist jobs SRCH KO htm for i in range req Request website headers headers page urlopen req soup BeautifulSoup page 'html parser' for item in soup select jobLink span print item get text Lastly you may be wondering how to go to different pages with the code and how you can scrape elements that are not on the front page of the website Well to answer the former you would implement a technique called pagination I will link an article for this and for the latter you would scrape each link on the website and iterate through each page collecting all the elements contained on each page How about data analytics I studied computer science and I feel that I'm not confident in programming yet And I feel that Data Science needs more programming and statistics than Data analytics So should I start with Data analytics thoughts Congratulations on hitting K and growing subscribers Have you now altered your goal viewing from the traffic analytics on your channel Thank you Awesome I think you could have searched ' R ' to find more about R studio because it's hard for someone to write a R like that Thank you ken jee I'm learning data science your video inspired me maybe i will make a blog to share my learning progress difficulties because I am a beginner etc Hi Ken Is freelancing a viable option for a data science career Or do you have to stick with one company i feel bad about my projects now this is amazing I don't think these kind of secrets are taking credibility from data scientists It is not about memorizing every bit of code It's about knowing how to get help and knowing what you are looking for Hey Ken can you recommend the best universities to get a master's degree in DS I watch your videos that are awesome I am a biggner and want to learn data science form very zero Soo plz tell me from where I should start my journey Hey man am doing master of sports analytics down in Melbourne Australia Coming from a sports science background definitely took me awhile to learn all the programming stuff I generally use R in my course btw But am still try to find a way to step into the sports analytics industry But if combine knowledge from sports science and sports Analytics is definitely cool Hahaha Both review options sound good Sir just one question do I really need to be an expert in maths for being a data scientist I'm actually not from Mathematics field should a pursue or drop Hey Ken How would you treat the udacity nanodegrees as inbetween bootcamp and certificates or more towards the certificate side For my situation I have an electrical eng background with some minor programming exp off the top off my head I'd probably upskill in statistics and programming on top of the data science skills to build my foundation right loving your channel a lot ken will definitely take your course once I brush up on basic skills and knowledge keep it up man Hello sir thanks for this project Can you please make a video on datascience project using image datasets Priyanka Roy Head of Data Artificial Intelligence at Intergen talks about vision for your AI strategy on Engati CX She says that companies should spend more time to know what the problem is work on it and the user and then bring in the technology She also mentions that data is extremely important and every AI strategy should be backed by data sir how to get notification on email if some one is entering there details on your portfolio Amazing portfolio Great review Ken Thanks for updating the discount unfortunately there is no way to buy it The order form is not active Data science vs data analytics what s the difference Thank you so much I was looking for a way to host a local server for crunching some baseball stats and you nailed the setup I ended up following you down your queries for fun and noticed that when I went to save my view I got this error Column names in each view or function must be unique Column name 'playerID' in view or function 'WinningPitchers' is specified more than once I found that curious since that's just from when we quoted out our join I am a software engineer from net background and it's been barely a month journeying into data science Your channel is an inspiration I look forward to learning more from your channel Cheers from Rwanda East Africa Pursuing this thanks for the information enjoying your content I'm years in the game almost have a masters degree in data science And recruiters treat me like im nothing because my educational experience isn't real to them Hundreds of applications Thoughtful cover letters Zero interviews My project portfolio needs an update but honestly I don't know what to do Im a data scientist but i can't even secure an unpaid data analyst internship INTERVIEW Any advice is welcome Almost time for me to submit mine Amazing portfolio and great review Ken Which is better internships or work as a freelancer Thank you Ken so much for the feedback I love what you're doing out here on YouTube and love the critical feedback You are more than welcome to share any of my projects or anything else I hadn't actually touched my website or much of GitHub all summer because I have been working a few research projects with my university among other things so this is great motivation to get back over there and update everything You have also inspired me to start sharing more of my work with the world Why people dislike this wtf You definitely know what you are good at in this Youtube realm You're not going to try and teach us how to build some text classification model like a SentDex would or other data science channels although im sure you eventually could develop into that Your niche is this stuff right here Resumes github portfolios examining reproducible projects and other things from the lens of someone in upper management It is very helpful and so unique Good work this reviewing projects series is really helpful Special thanks again to

Trivago project looks amazing It is very nicely structured and goes into great depth into the underlying math as well as summarizing the key findings in several data visualization plots It almost looks like a research paper perhaps it would be nice to format it as a research paper Key sections Abstract Introduction Materials Methods Results Discussion Conclusion Acknowledgements References and upload to arXiv org as a preprint might even look good in the resume also Very nice Employers will line up from now on Good luck Alexander Do you have a video on where to start on your data science journey I have less than one year to graduate from university and I m majoring in data analytics My university just recently made the data science major so I wasn t able to declare it I may just be overwhelmed any help is appreciated I learned python during the quarantine I also want to make projects that got me into the data science field though I'm not familiar with ml concepts I'm learning them I want some project ideas that I could add to my resume Right now I'm doing some beginners level project like Titanic survival and wine quality one But I want projects that could get me jobs Any idea where I can search for them I ve been meaning to send you mine but I m terrified of being roasted publicly I put this message here since it's your last video I was wondering if you will do a video on the following subject How to interact on kaggle to attract the attention of other people the kind that are helpful and likewise how can a newbie like me make a contribution ourselves as beginners on kaggle And in general what are the best ways to interact on the platform I ask because I believe finding some form of mentor ship from experienced people is one of biggest key or advantages you can get in learning any field but ML in particular your youtube videos and frank kane courses from sundog are good example Of course gaining some kind of a more direct mentor ship goes hand in hand with yourself being able to help and make contributions in return which seems the whole philosophy being kaggle so I was wondering if you would be willing to share a few secrets there I fully admit that it looks a bit intimidating at first sight In any case thanks for your youtubes videos Hi Ken you recommended having some sort of data collection element involved in our projects but how would you show that Other than including the datasets in your project files explaining in a writeup is there any way to show people what your data collection process is Also would you be able to make a video on working with big data hadoop sometime in the future if that's something you've had experience with I'm excited about the days of data idea Really helpful interview Thanks for your tutorial Can you please help me to scrap retweet user name for particular user in twitter There is something wrong with your promotion The yearly price is only off please correct and update When do we remove the NaN or null values and outliers in the dataset Very informative video Love the tone and your style of talking Any advice for someone who can't afford to finish their degree right now I have years of applied mathematics I so needed this right now Thanks for including people on this side of the spectrum the beginners Hi Ken i just wanted to say thank you so much I was on youtube all day looking for good video on data science I am trying to get a job on Data Science i have a degree on international studies and this is new to me i just don't know where to start Can someone who s not so good with Maths go for data science career path Pro tip just play this video at play speed thank me later Your wholesome click bait worked Just purchased your course on Udemy it was on sale for Thanks for making such a great resource Cheers Hi I'm a mathematics major college student and I've recently started working on data science I find making my own projects quite hard as I don't have any ideas to start with would be great if you could help Hello where do you recommend learning the necessary statistics needed for Data Science Thanks a lot Ken Can you please make a video on what software and programming skills are essential for a data scientist job I am currently learning deeplearning in python But I am still pretty weak in data visualization and plotting What should I learn for data visualization Which libraries in python or what other softwares should I learn to use Thanks for the great content Wow a very detailed lesson on single and multi regression with cross validation regarding your comment to have the actual selling price information is it for error computation or for model fitting will there be leakage if use in model fitting thanks Watch on speed thanks great content Is it alright to learn DS if the language you're using is c liked and subscribed Thanku Is competitive programming good for data scientist and if someone has participated into it and got a good result so can he mention that in his her resume Nice thanks Learned some great cleaning skills on datasets thanks I believe data science is a must have skill even when you think your current field is not related to data science eventually it would be Great lecture easy to understand and gain a lot of skills in the vedio Thanks great intro exploration easy for first timers nice recap for beginners thanks Thanks for this intro and starting with anaconda it very easy to follow i had been using jupyter since kind of only one i used i understand spyder can see the variable and dataframe easily i have a question for the same code and dataset which will run faster spyder or jupyter Thanks Can you do more videos on EDA This seems like the kind of top tier job you would get in silicon valley I'm from the midwest US and really want to see the more mundane and less glamorous jobs that are out here since I don't want to leave behind my family and friends and life in indiana to chase a dream job I know someone who works as a data analyst for CANON and a lot of his work is SQL queries and relational databases and excel spreadsheets Don't get me wrong your job looks amazing but it looks really competitive like applications per job for these sorts of things and something that would be near impossible with my background in the humanities edit You know I just re read this comment and it sounded rude So let me just say that I do really appreciate your content and videos So much respect for you Ken You are being transparent instead of hard selling like everyone else Does the dislike button hurt or help creators I bet The Countess survived V Judging by the amount of effort you put into organizing your thoughts and ideas and displaying them in your videos I can tell you would make an excellent lecturer Hi ken I want to know whether classical algorithmic concepts such as greedy methods divide and conquer dynamic programming etc are necesaary to learn before moving to ML Waiting for your reply What was his resources again data camp and data class where will I get it Hi Ken Thank you very much for sharing these info I am following you as a guide for my Data Science journey so I really appreciate everything you do Currently I am an account Manager but I feel burning in me the love for data science Data are my daily bread so I would like to manage data in a deep way and creating new value by doing it I agree that the best way for learning Data Science is by doing projects so do you think that the best could be finding projects for beginners on Kaggle or it could be better to do Kaggle projects without any kind of limit so in this case just with the purpose of increasing skills by doing different kind of data analysis Thank you again Ken and have a great day Hi Ken I hope you are well Thank you for the great deal of work you are doing to help here I was trying to replicate this video on my own on Spyder When I tried and x I got runcell 'C Users jider untitled py' in my console What would you advise I do to get through this please Hey Ken what are some good reads you recommended for building Data science knowledge I ll be going to Kaggle eventually as you mentioned I m at a community college learning c for the AS in Computer Science then transferring to a YR and getting the BS in Data Science and will learn python and R Sounds like clustering models unsupervised can be used to design database tables Thank you Ken for your contents I recently got data science course with your discount link because I noticed some basic knowledge gap from learning in an unstructured manner I hope to polish my skills and get a job before the year winds up Thank you Thank you for being brutally honest Respect Hey ken if you ever plan to make videos teaching data science concepts or any sort of tutorials but you are struggling with time try live streaming It will save so much time of yours since you don't have to edit them you can interact with us guys more often Hi ken I really like your voice I'm not a native English speaker and your video really helps me speak like a Data engineer HAHA I'm doing my master's degree in Data Science AI Personally speaking my college's courses and many resources like Andrew NG's lecture mainly focusing on mathematical theories If there are courses about job seeking it is really useful for me Thank you for your awesome content So honest Hi Ken I saw your course in it as i had already bought a one year package as my boot camp starts in a fortnight i am desperate for time to get my machine leaning code done in kaggle datasets i will go through your course after the bootcamp i am currently undergoing kaggle mini courses to get going the new visualisation course in also i on holding it lol i watch your titanin walkthrough several times its great but it is too high level for us beginners i am trying the easier one on estonia i wonder if you could do something like titanic on a much simplier dataset for those really beginners out there and me i like your voice tone speed its really easy to understand i like its guide learners very well but then we need more practise on datasets there is where kaggle comes in but its overwhelming for beginners too there are too much to learn to roam around in kaggle so i took the mini course to learn how to get its data and to submit Thanks for the contents i watch everyone of it Dude I literally binge watched almost all your videos Thank you so much for providing invaluable and informative information to the general public I felt that this channel is especially invaluable with those who do not have the ability to attend a higher level institution This channel clearly and concisely shows all the necessary steps and procedures to succeed in this field which I greatly admire and appreciate You're an actual legend keep up the amazing work Love your honesty those who save money because of this video will appreciate you a lot Beast gig I am new to deep learning Please let me know if my below pc is ok for it Processor AMD Phenom hi x core threads Ram gb ddr Graphic card ati gb ddr gb SSD tb hard disk Bought and video commented I like the fact that you made it clear that these aren't inherent skills or character sets but that they can be learnt I would work more on collaboration for personal projects both in Ds and web development this guy is such a great lad he's an inspiration for me at this point Production quality Camera mix editing speaking everything So much growth haha It's really cool to see Python and Anaconda fight in jupyter planet like an R rated movie Haha Ken I'm curious as to why you prefer spyder over jupyter Just your preferred editor This is a game changing playlist By far one of the most valuable lessons to date Thank you Always be plugging You have a great ethos from reading your comments and what I think of you Highlighting that your free content is already a great substitute is a great point to build trust We support you haha wow Great Video Man Is anyone else going to get the course just hear Ken's voice I bought the course after watching a Don't Buy My Course video why don't you come live for solving any data science case study so that we can code and solve along with you the case problems and learn from your approach I and my friends would love you to watch that if possible for you By the way watched and loved your every content you are very honest person in giving opinion thanks udemy courses are really affordable my first intro to machine learning is via udemy the good thing is that you can get answer of the questions which is not in youtube Big fan of your show and the guidance you provide Interviews like this are extremely helpful for those of us looking to get further into data science both from a motivational perspective someone did it here's proof and an instructional perspective here's a way someone did it it worked for them here's why and how Thank you again for doing this That is so honest and cool of course I recently brought it In an environment where people just market their products without considering its actual value there are a very few people who open up like this and be honest to their target audience Ethics is very important Thank you for the awesome content as always damn ken i sooo humble man love him Do you think this course can be done in a day like hours in total Also do you go through an in depth analysis about python or is it just rudimentary information about python I want to get better at my python skills What a great clickbait title I like it D I haven't seen such honest personality in my life who is thinking about people not about own Really appreciated your efforts I wish your all dreams come true I rarely leave comments on videos but as someone working towards landing my first DS job I ve found your content and channel extremely valuable I also appreciate your candor and transparency My college is sponsoring all courses on Coursera till end of September and I'm completing courses and their assignments for about hrs a day I have so many personal projects in mind which I wanna do but I'm not able to decide should I stop taking those courses and just do my projects instead I'm learning new stuff all the time through those courses and they great Currently completing the 'Applied Data Science with Python Specialization' and I plan on doing the Deep Learning Specialization after completing this one what do you think I should do Thanks for reading till the end I'm doing the Data Science Professional Certification by IBM on Coursera What's your opinion on it I really hope it's worth it I'm at course out of a total of Started just months ago and I'm overwhelmed by the amount of topics I need to learn One thing that really bothers me is that I don't know how deeply I need to understand a particular topic For example python Numpy pandas etc How much of it is required to be able to work effectively with data Any suggestions Ken I think we all would agree with that Is that a Joby tripod I see in the background Awesome gear Thank you sir for these recommendations Telling these things on youtube honestly is a big task Thank you for guiding us sir Ken Thank you for your honesty and authentic interest to share the joy of your profession I will continue to watch your videos to determine my next steps Keep up your great work will you provide certificate how do you compare coursea vs datascience Nice work on the logo You're honesty believability is is one of your strongest assets for this channel Obviously aside from your knowledge on the subject Bro if it wasn't for your content I wouldn't have a clue on how to break into DS Without it I'd be completely lost especially when it comes to sports analytics I'll definitely be checking out your course Thanks man Master Ken jee course is thing that can actually help student By paying little amount for course student actually value the course more Soon will join ur course Hey Ken surely gonna check out your course Could you also do a course specifically for sports analytics Cheers Ken Don't tell Udemy Also Ken Uploads the video on YouTube where anyone can see it loved your honesty btw ken Ken is slowly turning into my favourite YouTuber Thank you so much for your awesome content Lots of love from This man is immensely underrated You are awesome Ken Hey Ken to be honest I sort of knew that you were working with but I didn't know that you created an entire course for this It is very good to see that you really try to create as much value as possible I think this course will really benefit a lot of people Btw If a hypothetical person would be in the hypothetical position that they already have their portfolio set up and basically only want to lern about how to network in this field and get their foot into the door especially for more of a machine learning engineering rather than DS role do you think this course would be a good fit Maybe I'll buy it anyway tho just to support you Love your channel and your honesty You're an inspiration ALLAH BLESS YOU I plan on buying this just to support you for all the information you've given me not just related to data science but the way you really break down the ins and outs of the day to day data science processes You have impacted so many people and will continue to do so hopefully for a long time Is it worth it to Learn C as someone who knows R is familiar with Java and Python currently I am focusing on Python I've always appreciated your honesty from day and it's one of the reasons why I love watching your videos Such an honest review If you do feel that my course may be a good fit for you these are the places where you can find it off one year https datascience pxf io JG yR Discount on Data Science Monthly https datascience pxf io Wno O Udemy Just my course https www udemy com course how to start a career in data science referralCode D ED D A Do I need a degree to become a data analyst scientist i loved the days part look forward to it Great where did you go to college and what did you major in I really like your videos This channel makes data science more easy to digest piece by piece in an interesting way Also how old are you at this point and what age did you get your sports analysis job Just need to get a relative idea of my progress lmao Great video thank you but these sound more like strictly machine learning than data science tbh After years in IT mostly support I am starting to learn data science and it s my new goal started learning sql python and power BI That's so creative Francis Hey Ken I just wanted to say thank you for creating this channel and the content on it I always had an interest in Data Science but felt like it had such a high barrier to entry for me I never really thought much of doing it After graduating with my Bachelors in CS last year however I'll be entering grad school in a week for Data Science specifically with an intended goal to get into Sports Analytics for Baseball and having only discovered your channel a week ago I've been binging a lot of your videos on Data Science and Sports Analytics and am really thankful for all the great information you provide in all of the videos I've been following quite a few CS Software YouTube channels the past few years but always wished i could find a Data Science Sports Analytics channel so stumbling upon your channel was awesome to have happen This is a useful video to introduce newbie like me when we're ready to start our own projects In fact and since I've started your Data science project from scratch series it seems like this one or a remade one it seems the sound is a bit lower here mic issues this video or kind or video would be ideal for an episode zero of Data Science project from scratch Thats a great video I have been following your channel and love your work and its precise content Inspiring me in my data science path Great Stuff Thank you Ray Ojel for sharing your journey Its of great help Thanks Pal And all the very best Thanks Ken What he said about not understanding Kaggle notebook is very relatable I'm a software developer and I started taking interest in data science When I read other people's work on Kaggle the first time I got discouraged because I didn't understand their thought process As I started doing more courses online through Kaggle taking other courses and just playing around with some dataset I slowly began to understand other people's work All that is to say be patient keep learning and keep tinkering with datasets It's a marathon not a sprint You will be surprised by your progress Tigeragon will be a good name hey want to learn data science i am a beginner Really insightful study Learning on my own to be a data analyst I got some inspiration and also how to go about my learning plan Awesome and inspirational video Let me continue my practicing journey as i wait for your days of data video feeling so much positive thanks ken jee What would you recommend for learning Excel skills for Data Analysis some book or course doesn't matter Learned Basics of Python IPython NumPy started Pandas and then checked vacancies in my country and find out that for Entry Level in Data Analyst usually required Excel pivot tables DAX formulas Power Query and SQL PowerBI but it usually not in must have section In ish you copied the code from above and edit for the excel function but u forgot to edit the value count which is still 'aws' count so you said 'surprisingly data are the same ' D Needless to say your whole video is Great D Ken your videos are really helpful Can you please recommend a book or any material for analytics in soccer football As always great material I really found this helpful inspiring This is quality content Ken Thank you for this This is really inspiring I am on a similar path Also congrats to Ray on landing the job Amazing video Ken I was messaging you on LinkedIn other day Man there was so much to learn from this video Really loved the part about Ray following up on the question he missed never thought about it this way Also recently I've been reading some books about habit building too Atomic Habits by James Clear currenty trying to focus on habits and being consistent with my practice of data science I believe that the days of data science will be a great initiative hey Ken Jee why are there clocks behind you The blood moon is on the rise The fire burning in my eyes No nobody but me can keep me safe And I'm on my way this is so relevant im a recent math graduate and im also learning python to work towards a data analyst job thank you for sharing Inspiring conversation Ken the just scrape the code that scrapes the website so obv bruh Great Interview it's what I needed right now use css selectors to get html and use scrapy to scrape It's amazing Ken Keep connecting Keep pushing Keep learning Motivated Great interview I really enjoyed hearing his story Hey that s me Great Video Ken Thanks in my other Channel https www youtube com watch v bY YVQHrto t s I have reviewed DataCamp and DataQuest courses in Arabic and in English and I agree with him DataQuest content is much better than DataCamp This video has so much great advice for anyone seeking to break into the data science field Great content as always Ken I hope your Rubik's analogy isn't too accurate I never solved more than one side of that damn thing in the s and gave up I hope that doesn't mean I'm lacking the perseverance chops for data science Perfect easy short and explanatory Though it's late night AM but spending time watching this was worth enough I realize that if your background is in math or statistics you learn the programming part fairly easy since there are many packages etc but on the other hand if your background is CS software learning math stats take more time to catch up with If anyone can afford only one platform which one to choose DataCamp DataQuest DataScience Please provide your suggestions Thank you for the tips Ken I especially agree with the starting small part In the past I used to just consume most of my daily time to that new habit during the initial phase I would just see starting small as being not good enough However I realized that this was causing me to have burnouts frequently So even though changing your bad habits is hard I am trying to apply this advice and I can already see its benefits Wow that's great and amazing Superb BTW do you have a girlfriend or you are still single Nowadays majority of girls are looking for a partner who is Data Scientist according to Glass door I have also been learning on Dataquest and about to finish the Data Analyst path This gives me hope Let's keep learning and pushing People are not able to start their careers in this field Companies are not ready to invest their time on new incoming talents instead they want the ones with the excellent skills set and experience in the field While almost all the tech companies have their own Data Science departments the others which do not have one need a person with a lot of experience in this to start one What is your opinion on this Sir Correct me and suggest me Cool that's a good plan DaysDataInsight Yooo I think remember reading this guys comment here Congrats Ray Learning from other code examples is definitely very helpful in my opinion as well Sometimes you just need to see a hands on example of a function being used and it just clicks Knowing someone on the inside surely is helpful and that my network is something I want to put in more effort into as well Thanks for the review Very interesting to see the perspective of someone who also follows this channel Nice video ken Also one suggestion please try to add links to questions asked key points in video which will be easy for us to go through the video quickly Thanks do the days

Ken Keep it up Shit months is quick So in the meanwhile what do you do Work at Mac Donald s or live with your parents Is RegEx really that important for NLP Text mining in data analytics If it is then how can i master it Hey I m an SJSU studying Business Analytics I would love to get my github linked in to get reviewed if possible I watch your video twice or thrice in order to properly get the wisdom you r trying to convey Again Great work Damn just min ago i was watching your video and saw this guy's comment on it and after few minutes found this video Funny thing Back in my interview Data Science I was being asked a similar question referring to index values Very interesting talk Especially the barrier momentum discussion Thank you for this Good luck on your first day Ray You have a great and positive attitude I liked the video first then I watch it hahahaha Keep posting Never clicked so fast Thanks It was a really good But I would still prefer to take short courses from Bakeminds http datascience bakeminds com They have good range of short courses on Data Science I recommend people to visit this page if you are looking to learn data science https datascience bakeminds com search courses And provide number of resources for free like books blogs videos I've just started the path of learning DS and it feels like walking with a small candle inside a huge dark cave Thank you and other people like you who guide beginners in their journey It is recognized that you have big passion for this field Hey man thank you for this video Well what I want to achieve is to land an internship and I'm a total beginner How should I take this up from bagging a job point of view All videos are great thank you for great information Help me out here I'm gonna complete my Degree CSE dept I want to do my carrier in Data Science field I have pretty much of knowledge of data science but not so exactly What steps should I take now and after completing my degree Should I do Post Graduation in Data Science or learn by myself What is best for me Please guide me Super helpful I'm a civil engineer with SQL and Python experience I'm thinking of getting a Masters in Data Science to transition fully into the data science field Any advice I have the math foundation as we had to take up to non linear differential equations for the math minor I'm looking at WGU Hey Ken I have been watching your videos for a while now I have a business and computer science background more business and I don t quite seem to understand what the difference between BI and Data Science is Would a data scientist not also be interested in finding patterns in data and Analyse them in a way the company is able to increase revenue Amazing review kudos to Francis This is awesome Francis Go fam Thank you very much Ken for the review I'm definitely going to apply all the corrections and strongly consider all your suggestions Thank you very much Man I really appreciate it Hello there I haven't watched the full video yet but there's a reason for this and is linked to a suggestion I'd like to propose to you for similar videos in the future Despite being very VERY green in this I decided to have a first go at this all by myself and boy was and is it still frustrating P The reason behind this was that I wanted to try a first attempt without a guiding hand Once I finished my first model I quickly realized that there were tons of ways where I blundered like a total noob which is actually totally fine And despite the frustration of the experience it felt like I gathered valuable experience from this And it is only now that I am starting to watch this video but only bit by bit as I want to try to do as much by myself as possible mistake be damned since they are being done at home where it won't hurt anyone and where I can learn safely from the experience SO my suggestion is this Could it be possible for future similar videos to have it in several parts Or at the very least to timestamp the different section of your handling of a particular problem I feel like it could be very valuable especially for very recent newcomers like me Anyways thanks a ton for your videos very much appreciated especially some of the code where you use apply and lambda functions to handle data transformations this is definitely something that will be useful for me in the near and long future Signed A total newbie at this Hey Ken can you tell me how can I collect such types of interesting data likely as the whatsapp one from instagram or Spotify Thanks alot Hello Ken Jee Could you please share the template of your resume I am graduating this year and it would help me a lot Really well done Thanks Ken you are the only one make it simple to me please stay around to answer my questions when I get involved you are a great person really thanks again Great video Ken Generally Francis project was well implemented great job Also thanks Ken for the shoutout Another awesome video Ken Learned a lot on how to tell better stories with data By the way your new GitHub profile README is looking good as well I see that most of data scientist job requirements to have at least msc or phd in computer science or machine learning Is that true please need answer Makes me think you need a good note taking program that you are comfortable referencing This was such a fascinating video to watch I think this is my favorite in the series so far and one that i'll be definitely coming back to and making some detailed notes on Thanks for sharing the wealth of your knowledge Comment What's your opinion on putting class projects on github along side one or two of my own projcets I am now a sophomore and have only started to do my own projects completely on my own I want to start applying to interships but feel that only one or two projects of my own is two little Nice review Nailing the fundamentals is definitely the most important thing when it comes to portfolios or projects in general I also love how Francis used DS to analyze an actual situation of his life I will definitely put that on my idea list Also gj on updating your GitHub Readme Thanks for watching ev eryone Special thanks to Francis for submitting his work If you would like to have your project resume portfolio or LinkedIn reviewed please comment below and send me an email at KenJee ds gmail com Word cloud tutorial https www youtube com watch v k gin qfzi Great video Can you link the tutorial you mentioned regarding adding the word cloud to an image Make a video on how are you selecting the video for review are you using any sampling technique for the same Thanks for the work and share man keep posting Thanks for the tips I believe MNIST images are x So it would be pixels per image Please made video on sports analytics Oh no now I'm going to get video recommendations on how to beat the algorithm What constitutes the end of the video I know some Youtubers put their ads sponsorships at the end of the video but if someone doesn t watch that last part of the video because of the ads is that the end of the video I know the ending screens can take up the last seconds of the video so is it one minute till the end of the video or seconds to the end of the video Hey Ken Loved the video as always I'm still in college and I am aspiring to be a data scientist later on I just had a question that considering my current academic condition year is it all good if I use the code of other users giving them proper credit of course for my projects which I intend to present for securing an internship later on As always truly appreciate your videos Keep up the good work of helping us I apply the concept of exciting accountability in my life it involves making yourself accountable by telling people the internet that youre embarking in a project hopefully with a timeline this pushes me to keep through I did this by telling my friends and family I was learning how to code and that I was starting a YT channel and it has worked so far I love learning skills so I will definitely check your Ultralearning video Bro I am How can I gather experience and knowledge Thank you from Morocco keep going Broo Thanks for the series Ken I really appreciate it Small detail though but it looks like the y axis on the histogram in your EDA is labeled job state when it should be something like num job postings The content you post is exactly what I needed to trace my roadmap to become a Data Scientist Keep up the good work Hi I am from healthcare background nd i got admission in Canada tor Health Analytics I don't have prior knowledge in data science but i am interested But many of my aluminis told this will be very difficult for a person from healthcare background without knowledge in programing nd data science My program is one year post graduation diploma in Health Analytics in canada should i change my decision Can i do this Can you please guide me Hi Ken Really it was a great video on the data cleaning process as a data science beginner i was really finding the data cleaning part extremely irritating when it tried it on some of the beginner projects that you have recommended but after watching this video it would certainly help me a lot to practice more on data cleaning process I gotta be honest here started learning Data Science on my own but every now and then I become lazy AF and I just stop for a period of weeks It's difficult to be consistently committed to the program and learning Although I hope I slowly complete the training This is a compelling content I have been watching a lot of videos that say it is just about the algorithm Yours is different You are giving reply everyone good jo bro Is there a way to to confuse the algorithm to shuffle random videos instead of the learnt pattern Thank you so much for this Very helpful You're literally describing what exactly I am doing to be a data scientist Many thanks for confirming it Ken Jee have you some book or video about sport analytics to learn more about this field thank you Good Job Harold Hey Ken do you recommend Edureka I am a complete beginner and am trying to build my programming knowledge specifically for data science Thanks Hi Ken I just finish my Python Course and i'm also confused where to start about my DS Career i have learned Some libraries too but i'm still confused and i can't figure out how to maximize how to start without wasting my time Two questions as I haven't installed Anaconda yet Isn't there an Anaconda manager that allows to create and switch to different environments I mean you used code lines in cmd but if I'm not wrong that should be done by just clicking some commands in Ananconda navigator Am I wrong Tensorflow is a pain for my python version Which python version environment do you suggest for installing and using Tensorflow successfully Thanks great stuff ken I would love to see an interview of YT data scientist Hi Ken Deniz is speaking from Turkey Your videos are helping me a lot You force me to keep up amazing move at funny that the YouTube algorithm recommended me this video Great video man I am curious to hear your definition of 'maximising reach' as it was one of the key takeaways but was seemingly brushed over Hi Ken I am taking online course on data scientist currently with a institute known as Simplilearn Not yet complete the whole course but I am having preliminary exposure on data science using Python and R Thinking to apply a data science internship to accumulate my working experience Do you think it is a good time to apply for internship Funnily enough I literally found this video on my recommendations from the algorithm you just explained XD In all seriousness this is great content as always Thank you very much for video Ken I'm a Data Scientist and I was really curious about how the YouTube algorithm works Putting in good work man I would love to see an interview with a YouTube Data Scientist Hey Ken Kind of a random question but in an interview how would you go about describing a data science project you did that involved web scraping in particular the ethics of it Big fan Hey Ken is there a way to add multiple search queries within Python For example I want to search for tweets that include the term Australia and either olympics OR sport Commenting for the algorithm Great video Ken Do you happen to know if when you use a multi word keyword like Data Science Tutorial will it be part of the search result for the term tutorial or do you have to have a separate keyword for tutorial by itself also Haha I always love those random recommendations Great video as always I'm sure there is more to the algorithm I have a video on my other account sitting for years and it's been pretty stable in views The key is it was searched for explicitly It worked actually even after the days you mentioned just commenting to beat the algorithm great stuff Commenting for the algorithm Awesome video The throwing of the research paper was hilarious For all the advises that you are giving you are practically demonstrating them in action amazing I've recently been learning about recommender systems and It's interesting to know how YouTube's algorithm works especially when dealing with the cold start problem Great video Ken Thanks for great content Ken Can you make a video about math what kind of math do you use in job what part of math is need to know necessarily Regarding your insane growth rate you definitely cracked the YT Algorithm KEN JEE Problems k Growing that fast that your subscribe button is not up to date D Wonderful interview Ken quite insightful Hope you get the opportunity to interview a DS from YouTube Can you ask him her if they have noticed any adverse effects of optimising to boost the viewing time on the long term engagement of a user Ken giving a tip on how to keep people watching till the end and at the same time giving an example by telling us some insights will be given in the end Brilliant Hi What's the best major to become a data scientist That is some crazy original topic Instead of just shrugging it off with the classic It's just the AlGoRiThM dude you actually nail it Nice one Lets fight the YT algorithm together AS ONE FOR FRODOOOOOOOOOOO Edit I just went over the topic of k nearest neighbor in my DataScience course Moving on to matrices and how to manipulate them to with the help of linear regression model those k nearest neighbor predictions into more easily computable predictions correct me if i'm wrong When I got into datascience every new topic I met discouraged me and made me think I wasn't smart enough to actually learn it Now with the motivational help from what I've already done and channels like yours and others it all just feels like a super rewarding and challenging road You make an impact with these videos Thank you As both a creator and data scientist thanks man Great stuff YouTube is well known in its recommender system to favor content with lots of engagement As a result consider the like button of this particular video SMASHED Great details I loved the visual explanation you put in at and when you threw the paper into the back I could not supress a small laugh D This makes a lot of sense Excellent and very innovative content Awesome man I've watched your videos a lot that i forgot to subscribe btw i did it It felt so bad Hi There Great content once again Can I a person with no maths background or base even think of getting into Data Science Jee what about the course that WorldQuant University offers on Data science is it to the standards The course is free can it help one to learn well as a better course material and understand Data science fully Thank you for this amazing content At you looked at the value counts for aws not Excel Line says 'df aws value counts ' when it should say 'df excel value counts ' y hat base vc voting clf predict x test scaled astype int basic submission 'PassengerId' test data PassengerId 'Survived' y hat base vc base submission pd DataFrame data basic submission print base submission base submission to csv 'base submission csv' index False I executed the above code same as Ken used but i getting an error as array length does not match index length Can anyone please help me Love this series This is exactly what I need help with right now Thank you so much You're rock Ken Hello I m a computer programmer Been looking at getting into sports analytics Does being older make it harder to break into this field It just seems like most of the people I come across in sports analytics are pretty young Thank you U have a best data science chanel I love u Thanks alot No sql Do you have another way of determining the IDE you want to use outside of it being your preference The code for getting all tickers is very nice I had to go through this some months ago as well and didn't find helpful resources on that Additionally the code is understandable commented Thank you both Ken and Shile for sharing Hi Ken Your advices are really helpful and your work is praiseworthy Just wondering if you could make a video on how to write a cover letter Thanks Hey Ken i sent you an email I'm the guy from twitter sry fr bothering u Everyehere Ken Jee the data science quality content steamrolling machine D Great seeing all of those different perspectives on the topic You guys i e data science youtubers are severly underrated As a python developer I can safely say that to be able to do data science one doesnt really have to have that deep an understanding of python Its more about learning the concepts that you are laying out in these videos The learning of python should be your own separate thing Really enjoy the content BTW Nice one Ken Jee Hey ken been following you for a while been studying data science online and wanted to get a complete textbook with all the info anything you can suggest Hey I just started watching your videos Great content Looking forward to follow this series FYI You are awesome Never knew there were Data Science streamers The more platforms the community has the better Im confused of what i want to study Im good at math physics and chemistry which makes it harder for me to choose I already know that i want to do something with STEM My options till now are data science computer science mechanical engineering and chemical engineering I have learned the basics of python till now but dont know how to go further Great Thanks ken Haha I love the fact when I google his name and twitch 'nick wan twitch' the first thing is Nick Wan Doesn't Drink already hooks me in Great content as always An interesting conversation today It occurred to me that on job fair and recruiter sites you often don't see a separate category for 'data science ' This is despite so many firms looking for folks with that specialty It tells me there is a lot of room to run in this field Very encouraging What are some benefits to using spyder as opposed to jupyter notebook for your other steps or is this just preference GREAT videos man really enjoy all your content Your videos are really helpful and Kaggle is great Hi Ken Great interview At you mentioned something that I found really interesting Namely that there might be a potential divide of data science jobs in the future Do you happen to know any other sources blog posts YouTube videos etc that talk about that idea in more detail HI Ken Has it worked again what insight and recommendation can we say from the entire series of Project Please share At first I thought Twitch was only for gamers I was wrong it is also a great platform for data science Truly innovative and great value Nick is bringing to the community Hi Ken wanted to ask if its possible to make an API endpoint that takes in multiple rows or a file and outputs predictions for each row in that file at once Hey Ken Amazing video first of all So I'm a business undergrad student and I've been really interested in analytics for sometime now I do not have a background in computer science but I'm familiar w a few statistics concepts I've also started learning python side by side to eventually use it properly Do u think I should get these math concepts down before learning more python Also I know I'm already v late but I just find it fascinating and imo just makes me more employable at the end I only watch videos about AI if there is actual tangible content in them image completion generation nlp nlp nlg etc I'm nd year cs student I'm curious to know do i need to go for higher education in data science Or i can just complete my BE degree and then go for job experience Awesome array length does not match index length i am getting this error while executing the following code in titanic project I used the same code as Ken Jee used 'votingclf fit xtrainscaled ytrain yhatbasevc votingclf predict xtestscaled astype int basicsubmission 'PassengerId' testdata

Analyst Business Analyst roles Thank you Ken Thanks for the advice man I'm leaving a like Fantastic Videos Ken Your videos are the reason why I am still going on with my personal projects I ain't no master but I still try Great video Ken My goal I want to pivot out of career in finance advertising and into a career where I can answer questions in business or society via using numbers My intellectual curiosity is not being scratched anymore in my current career I want to dive headfirst into a field where not only is that intellectual curiosity being scratched but where I am also encouraged to explore learn and take risks Great video really helping me with my mini project I feel like lots of people are getting I to DS don't u think same It is a kind of buzz word DS Mantap Mantap Ok I see your real background is in Economics and then you've moved to Data Science with a master degree interesting I'm a chemical engineer finishing my PhD in process control engineering this year currently thinking about DS thanks for your videos man Thanks for the awesome video content like regular Ken You've really been starting to upload very frequently about practical data science content and your subscriber count has become indicative of that It really helps newbies like me try to get into data science It's interesting to see resumes from different sectors I think that can help people trying to get into that specific sector Just in general I think this is a really great series Also Reminder for you to update your GitHub start page I did update mine this week too Hi Ken what tools and libraries I should use to become a financial data scientist and can you recommend some good resources for learning Thanks Ken for another awesome video Clean and nice looking resume Special thanks to Shile for sending in his work Please comment below if you would like to have your projects reviewed and send me your work at kenjee ds gmail com Hey ken Would you prefer julia over python I want to do a risk related project but I m having trouble finding inspiration Always catching up new ideas from every videos Thanks Ken Always waiting for new videos in this series Thanks for emphasizing the importance of domain specialization Ken I ll definitely need to work more on that wow Me before the video I'm so ready to start applying to jobs with my resume Me mins in send help Hi hope you can help me out here I am doing my Honours in Mathematics and Finance and I have developed love for Data science during the year but I am not sure how to go about learning it coming from a mathematical and finance background I do not have that much experience with coding but I do have basic python skills I am not sure if I should do a masters programme in data science or if I should take on an online course Can you please help me out Happy I learned how to properly document code from your by scratch series Was a big help to a real data scientist problems we cannot figure out the problem even if it is in front of us Very nice playlist so far I have a major in electronics so maths required for data science is not an issue for me Can you guide me about other skills I should learn and how to get DS job as fresher Thank you for the Interview it Great interview I love this man very much you are actually making me a better Data Scientist Thanks Hey Ken the dropbox link provided isn't working Cheers This happened to me too Hi Ken Thank you for posting this I am looking to transition into the Data Science world I am strongly considering going to a bootcamp I am curious to know what your thoughts are I have a BA in Psychology have TAed statistics courses But I have been out of the field for a bit I am hoping that a bootcamp will help me to quickly learn the skills that will eventually lead me to a job I am nervous that employers won't take me seriously with only a BA Thanks Ken for this video it inspired me a lot and I think I got some motivation from your goals that you pasted on wall written in big words Hello sir My question is as i am data scientist aspirant and started learning R python practising tableau BI And i am also interested in learning SQL should i learn PL SQL or T SQL as a data scientist aspirant How much it is worthy to learn SQL or PL SQL or T SQL for me or none of them are required Thanks What kind of equipments do you need to take a data science course I hope you read this bro the course data science that you had described in your vlog information is showing only discount not can you check on this TIA Thank you Since learning that this field exists months ago it's all I think about and all I want to do That being said I have technical background and am starting this journey at Much harder for me to learn and retain at than it was at As much as I beat myself up for not getting it fast enough I also try to celebrate the small wins too Stumbled onto your channel a few days ago and can't get enough Thank you for this and all the other videos They really help Plagiarism can't exist in the IT world If you have a dataset and you need get some data out of it there are maybe solutions Even if people don't know each other they can have the same solution and or have the same way of writing code In the past i had idea Didn't talk about it or publish it I was working on it and about years later was not done yet a big company came with the same thing I have tried to prove that i came with the idea first But it didn't held up in court My like was the step from k to k I feel so accomplished updating my resume as we speak Eyy lmao im currently doing my bachelors in an electronics major gonna graduate next year and wanna go for a ms in data science do you recommend getting some work exp before that i don't have any industry exposure my internships were in the data science field but research oriented I love the new lighting really ups the professionalism of the channel Bridging the gap between the industry and academia that's my take away Amazing Thank you Ken For someone like me who has been working for different domains HR Analytics Business Analytics What do you think will be a good idea to create a mixed resume or have them separate My personal inclination is People's Analytics HR side but I don't see enough job openings here in India Your Guidance is appreciated ken can you share some details regarding the project based on nlp and cv man you videos are the best What were your skills and education when you applied for the first internship I care very much about getting and giving due credit as it is about humility Giving credit is hard especially if that person will get ahead faster than I will Getting credit is hard because it depends on other people giving credit I love your commitment towards teaching replying and liking each and every comment is not so easy but that's what making you special keep growing and keep sharing knowledge I hope one day you will reach your expectations thank you alooootttt What about Masters on Coursera Awesome channel I am a rising Junior majoring in Data Science with a concentration in AI I have always felt lucky that my school actually offers a Data Science undergrad program But I also feel like school does not provide as much practical experience or project based learning as internships do However getting an DS internship as someone who has only been in university for only two years is very difficult as well They don't think you have the skills or enough practice which is kinda true Just a big vicious cycle wanted k by the end of the year but you're already at k seems like you might get to k by the end of the year I bought a Lenovo IdeaPad flex laptop as i was a newb and didn't know about the gpu requirement This one has an AMD Radeon gpu I have the option to cancel the order Should i cancel it Hey Ken I hope this situation didn't hurt you too much I see a lot of people who are trying to catch a job with any methods and doesn't think about consequences of theirs actions I think it's kind of struggle for survive So don't be upset we are with you Please do a video detailing your cs masters how you chose it what courses in class homework coursework research work pre requisite studies formal informal Thanks please provide a list of your cs courses in Univ and outside Thanks that s a lot to learn in a masters I mean broad Very informative Well done Thank you Thanks for the video I have two questions though if someone don't mind answering Let's say I did a project without knowing someone else on the net did something similar to my projects is it plagiarism And if I get ideas from some others projects but codes are not copied at all Is it plagiarism Or what if I got inspiration from a project but did something completely different from what that project is Should I even cite the resources I got the inspiration even though the project is different Hi Ken At the cross validation part why didn't you check for the R for the different tests too Thanks for the video The same things happen in other branches of science or probably worse Intellectual rights of an ordinary people are never respected Wow what a in depth analysis You really put a lots of efforts into this This is my first try in Kaggle too after spending this much time i wonder how much time it will take for even tougher Data i also checked the House Rent Competition It have Features how can we do such a detailed analysis on all the features Not sure how the real world ML problems are solved where they might have or even more features I am really excited to know more You mean to say that plagiarism isn't wrong but not giving credits to the source is wrong Elon musk said that when we go to the depth of the problem and ask questions and slowly the layer unveils than we truly know whether the person has truly done it or was just part of the major project Is micromasters by edx after undergraduaition enough to get a internship or a entry level job also including some kaggle projects Dear Ken i have given a look at Sprawlball on your desk and i have checked on Amazon It looks like a book that talks about how to analyze basket matches My questions is in what ways might reading this book help a data scientist Hi Ken if I copy snippets from your notebook where exactly do I give you credits In the first cell of my notebook or the last one And do I just mention your name or do I also add a link to your notebook Me too Hello Ken how can a beginner like me get the most out of GitHub I want to enter the data analytics job field one day and I have been doing self learning I m gonna plagiarize that haircut Hi Ken Jee thank you so much for sharing your experience on data science I'm a statistics student and I am interested in data science I learned some R and C programming language in my uni but I'm not that good in programming Upon graduating I hesitate on whether to start working or further study in master program If further study in master program what course do you suggest Data science computer science or any other relevant course Looking forward to get your valued opinions Thank you Great clarification Ken Not only for Data Scientists but also for other professions In the world we're living today plagiarism is easy to do and I believe that most people do it without realising so clarifying this is important Thank you very much Ken Very valuable lesson Dear Ken am sorry to hear about this The saddest thing is that those who indulge to plagiarism do not understand that this practice tends to damage themselves and you rightly highlight this aspect If we want to strive for excellence then we must unveil the logic and try hard on our own Plagiarism does give one the opportunity to feel knowledgeable for one day but in the long term it will likely show how miserable one is The question is how might we seek out whether we have been plagiarized The topic of plagiarism concerns youtube too Do you want evidence Just look around and see how many times people post videos using copyrighted material Soccer is one of the many examples Or TV radio programs People merely do NOTHING and try to get visibility and even money using other's effort I recently had a quarrel with another guy who said You can wipe your axx with the Ethics In youtube world this makes no sense Welcome to the th century guys Hey Ken Another great advice from you I have been following your video for some time They have been really helpful with my preparation I would like to make a road map of my data science journey How do I learn more about the field of data science and associated disciplines Glad you made me clear about this issue While learning from notebooks in Kaggle and other sites I feel so low to use someones codes But I see this is common and a quite learning approach The thing that I shouldn't do is just not publish it as my own Thank you for clearing up my thoughts Sir I have a bid confusion in field of data science so please can you provide me your mail ID FOR THAT in will be grateful to you How did you find out that he copied awesome video Hello all and Mr Ken Jee It is very humble of Mr Ken to just have a light eye the person who copied his work I am a learning individual myself I do visit kaggle and github but to just get an idea of how the person has solved the problem and then i take almost one to two weeks to come up with my own unique solution Solving takes time Learn from elders and create something on your own Again Mr Ken is being very much liberal here But you will face a big issue when you go for Masters or research jobs You will get caught and it won't look good One other thing that Mr Ken did not address of course he doesn't want to scare the young ones is that a company hold power to blacklist you after being caught of fraud This means that you won't be able to apply for that company for upto years or forever depending on the policy and also the company can suggest your blacklisted profiles to partner organizations and you will be totally screwed Shadow learning is something very important to learn Shadows learning suggests learning the first principles from others works This means learning the thought process and not copying the core work Most of the researchers have ways of reaching a new success One is making something better or creating something new Shadow learning is something Einstein has done it himself He worked as a clerk in a patent office for years going through the research papers or maxwell's newtons etc Did he copy Absoluetly not When he found out that he was a bit lagging in the math section of E MC he contacted maxwell for his expertise on the derivations That's how we have Einsein Maxwells Equation See Einstein himself wasn't shy of giving credit to the fellow scientists Why should kids like us be shy of mentioning a partner or co worker or the sources name or the persons name Have an open mind like newton Let the apple fall and create something new Cheers and All the best People are good but people who share credits are great Peace I finished IBM's Data Science specialisation course on coursera few weeks ago The capstone project is peer graded I can assure you that there were plenty of students who simply copied and uploaded others' work It was utterly disgusting My goal is to build an app that uses data science to help others achieve their goals Thanks a lot for bringing up a serious topic Plagiarism can easily happen when coding and you pointed out very important stuff Hopefully people have a better understanding of plagiarism now Love how you always get straight to the point So sorry to hear that this happened to you Would you even write the source if you got some code from Stack Overflow I probably should start doing that huh Ghhh Ghhnn Hi Ken would like to know your host configuration for the machine learning With Siraj the real nail in the coffin was how badly he plagiarized that deep learning paper by replacing mathematical words with nonsense words complicated hilbert spaces haha I understand why people lie when there's little chance of getting caught I don't understand when people do it in a situation where they will almost certainly be caught Bravo Love the dramatic beginning hahaha already know it's going down It's great you took such an ambiguous topic and broke it down with rights and wrongs Really important to highlight the consequences too Great video Thanks for clearing that up Ken that s sucks man It really is important even when following your guides here on YouTube that you get the credit you deserve Hey Ken I'm very new to programming I followed along with your Glassdoor Project reproducing it for the UK I attempted every section myself before looking at the approach you took for each step of the DS pipeline But when I was stuck As this was my first end to end DS project this happened a lot I referred back to what you did Here is a link to my repository https github com TobiAdeniyi glassdoor proj Is the referencing Okay The results in the table are in question marks because it takes hour to run all the models DS loves pandas and set it as background Maybe green color helps to protect your eyes Time This is a pretty insightful topics in terms of originality regarding projects Now in terms of the finding the same dataset someone used and using different algorithms to do some analysis wouldn't that also kind of include people using common datasets from Kaggle in that case since it's the biggest source for data science projects I think some of this comes from being badly informed on proper protocols for giving credit just because something is freely available on Github doesn't mean it's free for anybody to just grab as their own with no strings attached and poor mechanisms for dealing with the understandably great pressure some face in the field Doesn't make it right though I agree with you that I doubt it typically comes from ill intentions On an unrelated note I think it's sy kit learn not sick it learn Sick it learn sounds like a modern experimental metal band or something I have a question in regards to your work being original and you having the ability to do it yourself and that being important to employers So with the web scraper example would you say that an employer would say that you maybe don't know how to do that Would they rather you go through and write it out fully yourself which would've substantially increased the length of that project And of course you knew it well enough to modify it And I will be clear I am not saying that you should copy it without giving any credit But if you did what you did would an employer say you don' t understand I hope that made sense Thanks I appreciate your channel If I did want to site your work from your data science project from scratch video what exact steps would I have to take Like what is the format for citing work Hello I am from Iran Could you please guid me to learn a programming language to find a job In Canada Hello sir I regularly go through your videos on data science As you said you follow some precoded template coding for most of the projects Rather than the GitHub code Could you please share some of your advanced codes for Data science projects python Thank You I had no idea you get more credit having shared that you are using non original sources Super counter intuitive at first but makes sense Ken great example of how handling a problem maturely brings you a net benefit Let s assume you freaked out put this guy on blast and moved on You d feel worse and I VERY green data scientist trying to learn the ropes wouldn t have learned this valuable lesson Your ability to calmly walk through the pros and cons helped out a lot of beginners and I m sure you feel better having taken mature action Would be great if you went through a project showing how to site work etc later down the road showing best practices Thank you so much for the video I followed along Unfortunately I got the result for Salary all the same values I am from the USA I checked Inspect section made sure that it's still gray salary Any ideas how I can fix it Very good information I agree with you that reading others code is the best way to learn I just uploaded a case study demo of data analytics While I think it is an important conversation I should point out that most of what you described is not plagiarism It is more intellectual property violations I think technologists have become so accustomed to software reuse that the lines have been blurred I agree with the principal of your commentary just pointing out the legal distinction in hopes of focusing the discussion into the appropriate arena of IP and open source licencing Thank you for your content I do enjoy watching it So if I used someone else s algorithm with totally different datasets I should cite the person on my project right Finally somebody called it out Thanks You mean you got sirajed Great topic and good video I think you set the appropriate tone overall I believe most people learn by copying following along mimicry whatever it is called at first I know that I have reproduced projects for the sake of learning Now when I follow along with someone's project I find it REALLY helpful to state where it came from on top This way I know where it came from and can return to the original material later if need be My personal thinking is that many many many did I say 'many' enough people forget the internet is open to a fault This is a very important topic I agree As you have said using someone else's code is very common in DS or just tech in general however it is important to credit the people correctly Some people may think I could have written that code myself which can of course be true in some situations but I like to think that using code is at least somewhat comparable to quoting in literature If you use a normal sentence such as the weather was nice obviously you don't need to quote anyone But if you want to use a longer paragraph of text or code in that matter it is very important to show the source Now in literature this is made pretty easy by placing quotation marks and just referencing the author but because code stays below the surface in many areas plagiarism can go unnoticed for far longer even though it is not less important to credit people in tech than it is in literature Thank you for making this video and bringing a bit of light onto this topic I think this is something which should be made very clear Edit When writing I just noticed that it makes a lot of sense for one's self to give proper credit as well As you said it makes people happy to see their code being used well So if you give proper credit you not only make yourself feel good because you did the right thing but also the creator because their work was used and they got credit On the other hand if you don't credit you feel bad for plagiarizing and the other person becomes angry because of it So giving proper credit is basically a win win Thanks for watching everyone To clear things up the work of mine was copied in an article that was published on a blogging website that you can make money off of If someone simply has this in their repo that is not as big of an issue but it should be cited there if they are applying for jobs Plagiarism is a serious issue in data science Hopefully this could help clear things up Thank you ken I know how you fell do you pop a Xanax before every video Have some inflection in your voice Thanks for the info bro Thank you what do you think is the future of Data Science jobs Will jobs remains with all this autoML pretrained model etc and so many people getting training in ML Very annoying background music Also in podcast Otherwise perfect Thank you for this informative video Sir this is truly helpful to young inexperienced present and soon to become data scientists such as myself As far as plagiarism goes with respect to code I have a question I'm sure that even on the internet there are some niche common and popular data sets which are considered to be the kind of must do's for new data scientists In such a scenario its probable that entirely different unrelated and isolated data scientists decide to use the exact same methodology to analyze the data in such scenarios how should one go about giving the due credit to the people who have already employed similar if not the same method for analysis Additionally on a completely unrelated note I have a school level class th and th high school coding competition coming up comprising of rounds The first one being questions related to coding and java python and c and the nd round being solving real world problems using code under the span of hour The second round is purely python coding based I only know vanilla python well most of the general functions and methods and have no experience with either java or c I was thinking of learning some modules I've briefly learned the foundations of throughout high school such as numpy math csv and either pyqt or tkinter Do you have any tips for me that could help me win this competition Its my first coding competition and I want to test myself against other coders from other schools and most of all see if my efforts have borne fruit Any tips or other modules I should revise or learn would be extremely helpful Finally I have one last question I've researched this quite a bit on both YouTube and the internet through articles but I haven't found any satisfactory answer to a question What's it like to be a Data Scientist I'm not asking the work schedule or when a DS wakes up what he she does at the start of the day and then what they do at work and after returning home what work do they do related to DS I want to know what is a data science life in general what do you do on off days how much me time do you get what kind of holidays do you get to connect with friends and families and just take it easy and take a break from work I'm eager to know the life side of work life balance with regards to being a data scientist Sorry if the comment is a bit too long its just that for me you are the only working professional and mentor figure I can ask these kinds of questions I'll be really glad if you respond And again thank you for making these videos they are a huge help It's nt a issue until and unless they are using ur codes in learning channels and earning money Becoz ultimately even if they get DS DA jobs by showing your codes they will definitely struggle to carry out data scientist role and threw out of organization One of the first things I look for when interviewing data scientist is whether their work is original Great video Valuable Information as always I love that Panda Wallpaper The pc build in the background I have seen this quite a lot Some articles I had read turned out to be plagiarized as well Sorry that it happened to you Thank you Ken You are a very good instructor tl dr of the video Statistics Probability theory Descriptive statistics Hypothesis testing Linear regression Discrete Mathematics Inductive and deductive reasoning Graph Theory Recursion Algorithm Complexity Linear Algebra Matrices and vectors Matrix multiplication Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors Calculus Integrals Derivatives Gradient Descent Thank You so much What do you think is the future of data scientist Will there be roles for data scientist in the future with gpt AutoML improved transfer learning models And with so many online resources and people getting into it You are super awesome for making this video I have a history degree feel free to laugh at me lol and no documented math backround except that my job in real estate required making and reviewing budgets I'm really hoping to land an analyst role after a bootcamp praying I won't need a bachelors Thank you for this information I just have one question How and where can I learn Python Programming from scratch I have no knowledge in it Does helping python for become a data scientist These fundamental type of videos you make are such a huge help Thank you for sharing your knowledge Absolutely legendary Amazing video to the both of you Hey man can you recommend a python course and I also have an interest in data science and i have a thing for interactive courses Brazil Hyperion like the titan in ancient greek mitology We need to separate State and education so there is no money to hide in the Education industry Instead Education needs people from Industry to teach so it is directly from the Job market what is being taught It is great seeing interviews with so many awesome people in the field I definitely agree with Anima on the learning part Having a great theoretical basis and a good amount of practical experience is probably the ideal combination Also congrats to the winner s of the Jetson Nano and swag I think Po is a really cool name for the PC D Thanks for sharing amazing stuff helping and encouraging Ken Focusing on making foundations strong Thanks for bringing an insightful interview with Anima Glad you also brought up this question I really agree with her opinion entirely Hope this will inspire the academic instructors to bring more interesting courses for their students Now we need her in Lex Fridman interview Great video Great Content Super cool to see that you also build computers About you breaking your side panel the funny thing is the same thing happened to my friend about a month ago who ordered that same lian li mid tower case He wasnt sure where he could purchase another panel separetely so he purchased another new case entirely After watching him gently placing the side panel down on the floor to remove the film it shattered again lol I also just upgraded very recently and made sure not to purchase that one and went with the nzxt Anyways just had to share this and let you know that you aren't an outlier Amazing thank you Nice Having joined Kaggle recently and due to one of your recommendations thanks and kuddos by the way D I feel that I am now ready to start these kind of projects Since I did followed successfully the two first courses of Frank kane it seems like a natural progression for me Really great interview guys hi thank you and keep doing this amazing job and i have question i was doing the same like you but i have problem is spider give this message module not found error can you help me thank yoou problem with gradual approach from experience is it requires managers that care about probability and statistics In Economics one is often faced with the demand from business people for just The Answer Probability is seen as cowardice This view is luckily fading Im and know nothing about data science but find the concept of it interesting Would I need college qualifications in this field to be accepted hypothetically I really enjoyed listening to this while I was working Listening to interviews always opens up so many more avenues to learn more too so I'm glad I tuned in do you have a podcast I'm a beginner How much machine learning theory hands on do I need to dive into Deep learning One doubt please clear this I have knowledge of ML any other technical knowledge and I want to do my carrier in DS field But I don't have any certificates I'm a final year CSE engineering student I need to place in company What steps should I talk Please help Wow such an inspirational video Finishing the video I just ran into seeing her full bio and got so much amazed and inspired Certainly there are more than just building models and implementing it I am in my rd year undergrad And needed a proper guidance about what to choose between research and industry This video helped me a lot to get a good intuition Thanks a lot Finally you started to bring amazing people Eagerly Waiting for entrepreneurs Seems she has some Indian History As a visual learner I understand the video better with texts and graphics accompanied Nice video Looking forward more Do you think using Kaggle as portfolio projects is a good idea for data science projects Excellent Insights Great to hear someone who is implementing these concepts in their everyday work have just discovered today that have not subcribed to your channel poor me lol Great conversation I loved the content discussed The maturity of AI hardware among other aspects is going to be the one of the most promising future topics I mean look at IPUs FPGAs TPUs etc in addition to great Nvidia upcoming datacenter AMD GPUs I love her personality Thanks Ken for making this interview happen Great Video keep doing the great work and I am pretty sure one day will come when you will be getting interviewed just like that as Legend of DS and AI Hello there Thanks for these videos actually i have a query i am on my way on the data science course from careers on udemy They will provide us with completion certificate so does it give any value to my resume And what ppl ask in interviews for freshers plz make a specific video on it if possible as experienced ppl know how industry works Bdw it's great to see that you reply to all the comments Thank you for showing such efforts god bless you You're growing so fast in terms of subscribers and I'm loving that because there is no any data science Youtube channel that's growing this fast and I hope that you'll be hitting k subscribers very soon this year Gained a lot of insights from this interview Ken I love how Anima explained AI and ML in an interesting way maybe a raffle for a free DGX for one you subscribers D Just a suggestion I have undergraduate in financial engineering and I want to pursue a master in Data science and business analysis I do have this much of coding background any advice Ken Jee Hey Ken I'm and i'm considering really getting into data science and machine learning after going through the field on and off over the last couple of years Would you say it's pretty late for me to get into the field Can you suggest ways that late comers into the field might find an edge for themselves What would you say or advise as an employer or someone hiring new data scientists What would make an older applicant late comer more of an attractive employee or colleague compared to younger applicants so eager and excited I hope next one will be ceo of nvidia haha but I'm really excited for this one I can't wait This is my aspiring field Goldmember You built this rig around that beautiful gold Titan card so I think the name should reflect that Also one of the all time great Bond films Wow okay need to watch this Super excited for this one I used Nvidia style GAN to generate character game armor Really love their stuff Thanks for always brining awesome content man Listen to Ken's Nearest Neighbors on all the main podcast platforms

question I have one year left in the Master of Economic Analysis Modelling in Rabat Morocco I am familiar with Excel R and statistical packages like EViews SPSS but I was rejected from many Data Analyst internships in the US So for now I started an internship in Morocco where I basically make a questionnaire for a certain sampe collect data and analyse results I have been also learning Python and Tableau because they were mentioned in the requirements of most Data analyst internships Do you think I can land an internship next spring in the US with my anticipated level Also how was the evolution of Data Analyst jobs and internships impacted by Covid Thanks a bunch God Bless u Very helpful video man You've gained a sub Appreciate the content thank you so much Why do I feel this guy is pretty pretty awesome keep up the good work man Hey Ken I really appreciate your videos I've been studying Data Science Statistics and coding and I feel a little lost about how to build a portfolio Can you suggest me or give me some hints of how to do that How is data scientist in india is BS a good degree fro landing a job in the field of data science Is notre dam fire a searched keywords in tweets or what does it refers to And how to add the parameter of hashtag This is perfect videos How about a movement the other way around from R to Python or at least how to start obtaining some fluency in python when you have started with learning R thanks HI Ken Please make more videos on end to end project like this starting from data collection to documentation I m working with a dataset containing around rows and my grid search has been running for around hours now using the same parameters as you Is this normal Could Jupyter notebooks potentially be the problem Hi Ken Based on your experience do you think consider as possible to start a carrer in data science at age I studied industrial engineer and I am interested on it but i ask it because of the needed time average to become a good data scientist Greetings Hi Ken thank you for the fantastic video I am having an issue with my linear regression I was getting an error that my X sm was an object so i converted it to a float but my R squared value is which just doesn't seem to be correct Any ideas Thanks again Hi Ken I've been watching your content for a while now and I love what you put out Thank you for the videos I do have a small request Could you perhaps remove the background music in your videos Sometimes the music comes off as irritating and given that the main content of your videos is the dialogue I feel like it's unnecessary to have the background music for the type of videos you make Keep putting out the great content I'm learning a lot from you Mine starting from June was to learn Rstudio and Python I got the basic machine learning in Rstudio and data visualization in Python I wanna understand neural networks in R and basic machine learning in Python before school starts Birger is a Scandinavian name from Old Norse bjarga meaning to help to save to protect Ken you're look smart bro Awesome advice I have just begun my DS journey and this gave a roadmap Thank you Ken This review was just like your haircut Excellent Ken Jee series Netflix Focusing on my GitHub readme these days you look Ken this hairstyle is also good but your previous one was better Special thanks again to Talha If you would like your projects reviewed please send your links to kenjee ds gmail com Thank you for making this informative video Sir You stated that inculcation of an additional discipline along with Data Science provides a boost to your resume however for students who are aspiring to be data scientists and will shortly join college how will they be able to get the added benefit of having experience in another discipline If I restrict my argument to myself I will be pursuing either a DS or a CS under graduate degree how can I compete against individuals who have the added edge of another discipline Another question I have is could you do a full tutorial style video on how one goes about making their profiles on platforms such as LinkedIn GitHub or Stack Overflow And which platform carries the most weight in recruiters' eyes as an adolescent I feel daunted by the thought of making a good profile as not only am I inexperienced but I'm also unaware of the do's and dont's Videos such as these project reviews are extremely useful for more experienced watchers but a video targeted towards the newcomers would be a boon PS If you can please tell what name you decided on for your new PC Once again thank you for making these videos I cannot stress enough how helpful they are Watching your videos and observing them is really helping me with the workflow and approach towards my projects awesome video fboy haircut m Commenting code is just like data cleaning the one part of the process no one likes to do xD Great review Combining fields is something I never really thought about but that is really great advice The new haircut looks nice as well I was thinking as the video went on that you should do another video It's been almost a year and a comparison would be pretty good But if you did it live Then we'd get to see how you would apply data analysis to your YouTube channel I bet you'd have some really good numbers to report on with pretty steady growth This is just what I needed to improve my GitHub READMEs By the way looking fresh with the new haircut Ken Great video Ken the projects are awesome with a biomedical focus I'll definitely look into this Cool haircut by the way Great video Oh yeah loved your haircut Literally the first thing that got my attention was the haircut Fresh start to the video already Please keep this series coming I am way behind and need to catch up but Im very excited to have the time to go through all of these Awesome video Ken really enjoyed learning from your experiences I'm an engineering student looking into using consulting as a stepping stone into data science but your video is giving me some second thoughts about the consulting piece Are there some red flags about this plan that I'm not seeing I've reached out on LinkedIn if you'd rather respond over PM Thanks man Thanks Ken Thank you ken i never thought i would come this far in data science and you made it much easier to understand hi ken i have been working as a sports analyst from last one year for a company called HUDL its headquarter is in nebraska working for that company i have done analysis for many high school teams across USA in American Football also done NbA ANALYSIS nd done different project regarding soccer like player tracking event tagging also i knw about lacrosse analysis i want to pursue my career in this field nd my main interest is in american football or the NFL and NBA i really think i can do wonder in NFL AND NBA like projects please help me out with that What are your pc specs For a data scientist job So cool to see me in there haha Keep up the awesome stuff Ken Hey Kan Lee I am doing a project like foodcouver but I created a scrapper for various websites As a result I have thousands of text reviews and ratings Do you think it is good for a project to mention how did I got the data but no which websites I used My goal is a recommendation system with aggregated data of course free But I am afraid that some of the websites may not like this idea How am I supposed to scrape if many websites restringe their use I would like to know what do you think Thanks Ryz Cruncher just for its sheer performance and number crunching potential well you are doing machine learning so somewhat implies you are working with a robot xD Amazing videos Ken I am happy to find your channel Keep up good work Nice home exterior view u have Hi Ken really appreciate the time and effort covering the technical aspects of data science as opposed to just a generic theoretical road map suggested by many Helps to put things into perspective for those keen in this field Great work btw thanks for these great recommendations Thank you very much I am not sure whether you have posted video about data analyst or not but please would you post video which explain difference between data analyst and data scientist How much of CS do you actually need I was planning to do a Math Physics Stats combo Is it important to have a formal degree to progress forward Because I was planning to do the entire coding part on my own without taking on site classes for that Hey l just saw your channel which is totally helpful to me I am a civil engineer and want to get in this specific field I haven't started to study yet but I believe that your videos will temp me to do it And also do you have an Instagram Hey you got an awesome channel with a lot of valuable videos Do you think data science jobs could become non existent in the future with the possibility of it getting automated using tools and having non specialists utilize those tools Name it KAIJU Hey Ken your videos are superb I recently worked on a dataset Could you see it is fine or not This video is a great help I'm a graduating student in BS Forestry but technology and programming is my passion Do you think there is a field in Data Science where I can still apply my degree And do you think I should take another degree or should I just take Masters and Certificates Thank you so much this video is very helpful and I like how you still reply to every comments until now Professor like from money heist because its seemingly calm with the lovely white exterior and nice lighting but in reality nothing is stopping its constantly fierce compute power and GENIUS Loved the video what a beautiful machine Hey I am planning to do my Masters from Canada currently do IT Engineering from India and I wanna go for a data science course I have one internship in data sc and still learning data science But I have seen many of the Canada universities offer courses like Data analytics Data analytics in business Data Science Are these good to go for if you are planning to become a data scientist Hi Ken Love your work and it really helps me a lot I hope you can review my resume and give me some insight Thank you I started studying Data Science in April I'm definitely going to be working on these projects Thanks for this channel it is awesome I just found it please continue to make quality content D I'm using python version and even after installing wordcloud using pip anaconda wouldn't recognise it in the environment From what I've learnt online after researching I found wordcloud isn't supported for python version and above What should I do Downloading ipynb from github as py file Loading Public Notebooks Directly from GitHub in google colab https colab research google com github googlecolab colabtools blob master notebooks colab github demo ipynb scrollTo K NVg RjyeTk From colab you can then just download the ipynb file as py file Saves a lot of hassles Thanks for sharing Ken Definitely learned a lot from your story Data science a vast collabration and especially biology data science There will be more insights and exiting in this field Keep the updates upto us ALL THE TIME Thankyou Do make series on projects hands on Thanks for the video really interesting video I'm actually a product guy but love to use all the data available to do my work Provides me lots of valuable information about product usage market potential impact on business and so on Keep it going Thanks My name suggestion is Monarch Ken I just found your channel and coming from a software engineering background I find great value in your data science related videos Thanks for your inspiring stories of success Slytherin As in one of the Hogwart houses in Harry Potter That serpent python household will surely make your pc into some magical beast Thanks for the video How about BlackDeath After a famous chess player Henry Blackburne Just beginning to explore a career change into data science Thanks for the great video I'll be sure to watch some more I see all these creative names in the comments while my awake brain cells thought Thor this video was so much fun

had to watch It was last week Then I returned in order to find a video on Where to start learning But what you talked about was How to learn I mean the advices were No matter what courses you watch just make sure to do in a way that you feel that works for you Look into Kaggle and learn from built projects and such However what I couldn't find is exactly where to start on languages Please please don't get me wrong I'm just trying to understand where to focus the inicial focus to learn this science What I was looking for was something more fundamental like Start learning Progamming Logics then you should tackle the basics of a programming language like R or Python then you should learn about DB with I don't even know if it is necessary to learn about database to be on Data Science lol Again don't get me wrong In reality I'm asking you What are the fundamentals to start to learn this awesome job I see the enthusiasm about this topic on your videos and for a long time I had this will to learn however I'm not a programmer myself in any language at all Could you please help me to find the initial step Thank you for your videos they made me like Data Science even more even when I don't understand almost nothing about this world Wish you success and waiting to see more videos If not about my request well Data Science is already enough for me to follow the channel Really love the casual advice he provides through his videos And really like those random shots of reptiles and to make the video more engaging hey where can i get raw data which you scraped Hey how do you calc your usual rate I heard the rule of thumb is of the annual salary per day Also do you think that freelancing in data science is the way to go I'd prefer to work on a project by project basis rather than being an employee and doing the same every month Thanks Ken for sharing your experience in landing the contract job Really like the background the aesthetics lighting plants are awesome DEITY a god cos that's what you are building Hi Ken thanks for this awesome series I'm literally stuck at the end of this tutorial it looks like stopwords variable isn't really pointing at the Corpusreader object in nltk I'm getting the error code TypeError 'WordListCorpusReader' object is not iterable Any tips The content is super cool just like its author Ken thank you Sir this was informative indeed always awaiting ken jees videos Hey Ken Fantastic series When you instantiated GridSearchCV as gs and passed rf parameters and scoring in it it also requires verbose parameter mine is not executing without verbose ps am using jupyter notebook Nice Thanks for the information brother Sir Is it beneficial to do Data scientist course with B Sc in physics or with Bachelor of Computer Application BCA Ken Jee good luck Really appreciate your work Ken Thanks for sharing your content Can you share your experience on some real world project It will be very helpful Really appreciate your help Thanks and please don't stop posting such nice video Helping me a lot Thanks very useful video may i know for the person who is not from the IT background and if they want to start which software they should learn or in more demand Salesforce Tableau QlikView or POWER BI I am very good in excelsheet and i like to find the correlation between two events or things If you dont mind may i know from where should i start I've been interested in data science consulting for a while now Developing relationships in business is so important something you can't learn in a deep learning course Screen goals ftw Tesoro italian for treasure because that pc is gold Stormbreaker Thanks a lot Really useful advice for fresh graduates so after i graduated in civil eng i did some worked hated it so had to quit tryna find my self i came across data science its soemthing if i put in effort i can truly be great but i have been studying since months i havent achieved the mastery people online tell so its really getting frustating for me because idk maybe i get too overwhelmed from the codes i see and i am like how i dont know this basic code i can understand the methods involved but i dont feel confident enough for a job but i need atleast an intern job or something because i just acnt sit at home seeing my life passing by i know its much i had to let it out somewhere sharing experience and advice would be helpful Now you really seem confident in this video The stock clips were a nice addition as well I particularly like that you only put them into the video sparingly It's just incredible how much you and your channel has evolved in such a relatively short period of time Very inspirational Hi Ken I know it is not related to the video but I got a question I was planning to start a Data Science club at my high school and what suggestions do you have for projects and stuff like that to do at the club that are friendly for high school students Thank You Ken I would suggest Black Mamba just for reason and that is Kobe Bryant I am a huge basketball fan I know that you are into Sports Analytics so that will be the perfect name Hey Ken your doing a fabulous job Your videos help me a lot Thank you mate I wanted to ask you how do you manage time Because in this field you gotta put in hours and I'm that kind of guy who like to relax on weekends after a hard week I mean how do you do it I mean being on YouTube and learning new everyday and working your job Can you please share some insights You also reply try to reply to almost every comments which is one of the reason I love your channel Thankyou Ken Love Dinesh This video is a bit hard for me to follow so I tried some alternative and found someone else already mentioned in the comment that is to use Streamlit I personally find it easier to use to build the model into a web app compared to flask ken Thanks for your work and time man keep posting All videos are helpful in some or the other way Got rejected today W told that the deadline was today so they couldn't put me in the project They literally gave me the dates to choose and I choose accordingly Ohh well Thanks for watching everyone I recommend watching this video next about how to get data science experience without a job https www youtube com watch v pWVQ vN uig Thinkin of leaving academia once I m done my PhD genomics so thanks for this While starting DS path amd having about months to get first internship should I focus only data analyst things or data engineering skills Hi Ken just an idea to better extract seniority information if we could take how many years experience required from the job description that would be a good indicator For now a lot of jobs seniority is na Just my cents opinion Also do you still accept resume revision request I've watched your serious of videos on resume and modified mine accordingly it'd be great if you can take a quick look at it and provide any feedback thank you so much What was your rate that ended up being discounted Thank you so much DeepBeest sir can you make video on types of white board questions that are been asked by data scientists during interview Good video I'd like to know what you think about platforms like upwork though Are they worth using Thank you ken for sharing this Can you tell us more about which field you should choose as you have a sports field or how one can select the particular field or what areas of fields are available Thanks for sharing your story Ken Also where did you get the short clips in between your video Clips like plants growing a person writing the word analytics and stuff Thanks for sharing Ken You ve quickly become one of my favorite Youtubers I ve been learning data science while attending college and I m hoping to become a data scientist after my enlistment in the Air Force Hi Ken I love you videos Can you please suggest a data science course that provides project and placement too Zehahahaha First Hi There is it needed to know selenium Thank you so much ken for Markdown cheatsheet and for providing all the valuable information through this project whole series finally completed the whole series still facing few problems error but I will try to solve it keep making videos like this best wishes for your channel Thank you once again Thanks a lot of insight from this Hey ken 'touch' is not recognized as an internal or external command operable program or batch file' how to solve this error please help I want to start learning data science but I am a bit overwhelmed with the number of courses and videos can anyone please guide me with a road map or something so I could learn and start practising as soon as possible Hey Ken Jee I have a question Are Big Data Spark Hive etc used by Data Scientist Hi Ken what's the practical way to prevent multicollinearity hv we done anything to prevent it in this project Because I didn't see any prevention after you creating the corr heatmap sir is competitive programming and hackathons necessary for data science Yes Keep these coming Hi Ken I have tried it and I am getting another error thus element not interactable element has zero size Session info chrome I have searched Google for it and have not been able to have the solution please help Would you think it would be helpful to put projects we did in University on our GitHub pages I'm a new grad I just read Circe a book about the daughter of Helios the titan god of the sun He was a jerk as were all the gods in the story but Circe was pretty awesome She was clever devious and a problem solver I think Circe would be a good name Realizing that my odds of establishing a lush career in the field of data science in my middle to upper s are at a probability of close to zero given my past employment history going all the way back to dropping out of high school this video gives me hope that anything is possible with enough devotion dedication desire and willpower I love this Thanks Hi Ken your videos are very educational Thanks a lot for putting out this content I'm trying to combine my experience in working in start up finance to transition to data science What do you think the challenges will be coming from a non CS background Content monitor background and polo are on point Having a mentor seems like a very cool idea just having someone you can connect with and learn from while of course making a great new friend I think it can be very difficult to find a mentor especially if you're starting out or data science is not really as established in your country I look forward to meeting more awesome people on my way and I am super grateful for everyone I have met so far These longer videos are really in depth and I quite enjoy that This Lasso instance is not fitted yet Call 'fit' with appropriate arguments before using this estimator how to fix this error can't find anything in StackOverflow Hey great series I am not able to fetch salary data in glassdoor of my country It's not showing there can you suggest a way around Th Hi Ken I am looking for mentorship in ml ops side activities like production model deployment pipeline monitoring audit model auto retraining etc Plz guide pathway or may be can i reach out to Dan Hey Ken is it really important to complete all micro courses like intermediate machine learning and like that is kaggle to do our first project These videos are so helpful and have made me truly excited about learning data science How long does it take to become data scientist What level of mathematics should one have in order to start Prometheus the Ryzen Titan Have no idea what the kit is for but I just started taking data science classes so it d be some super delayed gratification ken jee do u recommend all this programs in that order as in st start with kaggle micro courses then when done move onto google machine learning crash course and then when done fast AI because towards the end of the video u emphasized a lot on kaggle but did not mention the other programs so do I need to take the three in that order to grow my understanding in beginning data science or any of the three will do please kindly elaborate Thanks for the video Ken and Congratulations on your course with wish you more success keep up the good work Wow wonderful video I am a data analytics professional trying to set pitch into data science role and working with data science teams within my current organization is what I am trying to do as well Hope I succeed in that Thanks for this video Do you think it s realistic to strive for a Data Science career having only a highschool education Most job descriptions make it seem like having a masters college degree is not optional but I really like Python and Machine Learning Would I be more successful trying to become a software engineer instead This was a great video Ken Hey Ken which courses should one do out of the courses that you mentioned on Kaggle for a foundational knowledge before one moves onto projects Because there are about of them on Kaggle Help out Hey Ken big fan Would you be interested in a colab First time creator and I just started making videos a month ago You're an inspiration Leave a comment anywhere on my channel and let's make something happen I am switching into data science after years of experience I was an IT Quality analyst for years but I am not into IT for the past years I am planning to join full time Masters in Data Science in UK and switch my career Will this be a good idea Some universities focus on statistics and deep learning more and some are focusing on computer courses Which one will be better to choose Thanks for sharing Hearing someone else made it the way I'm trying to get through it really helped me to know I'm on the right path What's cool about the data science world is that everyone has different backgrounds and stories I Really enjoyed the podcast and I'm looking forward to the future ones as well Greetings from Brazil I am migrating to the field and your channel has been helping me a lot quick questions Where is a good place to learn python efficiently without spending too much money or any at all Do you have any suggestions for podcasts about sports analytics baseball and basketball are what I m interested in Key Ken just sent you an email Hope I can make it into one of your episodes Gogoogoggo If someone is introverted then what is your optimum requirement Like you said in linkedin profile they don't wanna share everything so what's your take on this Thank you so much for your videos I am about to start my journey This is such a great channel I love your mindset and the way you explain things This was very helpful Please keep them coming Ken You don't know how happy this video made me I currently have impostor syndrome and I plan on applying to an internship next week I was worried I wouldn't know enough and that I won't be able to perform to their expectations Knowing that it's common for DS to reference their old works or constantly use outside resources is such a big relief If I end up getting a job its because of you You've contributed so much to my growth Thanks for everything Ken Hello Ken really cool video I have a question for you You gave us all the important variables that contributed to the model at around I was wondering with those variables in mind are we able to dig a little deeper and see what the actual values were that contributed most to the model If that sounds confusing here is an example Age is the second most significant variable in the model If we can program what I just asked you the model would spit out ages years I do not know if that's true old were the most significant and contributed most to the model This is my first data science project so I want to apologize in advance if my words do not sound data sciency enough RuntimeWarning Glyph missing from current font Hey Ken getting this error help please Hi Ken when tuning the model for random forest you use RandomizedSearchCV and then GridSearchCV Your comment is Because the total feature space is so large I used a randomized search to narrow down the paramters for the model I took the best model from this and did a more granular search Do your mean the GridSearchCV' parameters are based on the its above RandomizedSearchCV' results ken jee good day bro and thanks all the content have been downloading each one am about embarking on a masters program in data science At the industrial university Tyumen and all I have is a b sc in mathematics your videos have been helpful as I seek to begin a career defining path in data science But the masters program I feel a bit insecure having no background in data science but plan on remedying that by going thru your advice on how to start data science from scratch plan to use my first year in personal study while learning the language to learn and gain mastery in data science so by the second year while am going into the core of the program am caught up what do u think too much or just ambitious enough Your honest thoughts would be most appreciated and i How do I know if I have seen enough beginner tutorials to start working on such start to end projects Also how should I practice the beginner tutorials Hey such an informative video thanks I have a doubt do we get certificates after the completion of these courses Pls check if anyone can help Ken Jee on laptop in background is meta Is sports analytics Gambling or no I am in a serious dilemma should one go striaght for Deep learning or practise machine learning Thnx

you to give a read to my article on medium about one of the topic you talked about 'ULTRALEARNING' I've mentioned the link https medium com jairajc ultralearning fe a f cc I'd like to have your feed back on the same Thank you How do we project Soccer games Please help I was not confident about my Git I would love to watch some tutorial in showcase current project or any upcoming project great vid sweet and to the point thanks for this Thanks Ken for another awesome resume review Nice GitHub portfolio projects were quite unique and shows a great level of creativity kudos to Thinam What advice will you give for someone with no background on Science Engineering Math and technology but has a business administration degree in Marketing Should he or she go forba Masters or bootcamp or take the certificate approach Loved the overall review Not exactly cost efficient way of doing things hi ken i have been learning data science with python after losing my job in pandemic as web developer wordpress html php etc can i get a good job do i have a good chance Ken Jee Great video as usual Thanks Sir I have completed micro course you suggested on kaggle but I don't know how to do projects and how to select them Please help me with that Great video Any tips for a mid s changing career fields from XYZ to a data science related field Great Video Mr ken Should be called El Tigre for sure Thanks Sir Ken I must confess you are such an exceptional mentor I had been looking for a way to get on on this journey until I found your videos and several platforms within two weeks of watching your videos and practicing what you teach I can see I am making so much progress Thanks so much and God Bless you I think data science is the first career that I've considered where I didn't look up the salary before looking into it more lol What editor do you use Microsoft visual studio code Hi Ken I have a problem in Kaggle I don t know if you can help me Since the training set has all features and test set has all except the predicting one I cant predict y for the test set because is not the same shape that the train set that i use to fit How can I solve it Hello First of all thanks for all your great videos I want your help regarding my ML path I have been learning ML for almost months I have done few courses on udemy and coursera but still if I follow some professional's repository or if I open the libraries codes for debugging I cannot understand alot of python stuff like how the functions are written and other advanced stuff So if you can suggest me some specific python course that can make me comfortable with all these things I am currently doing ML engineering nanodegree from udacity but that is also too costly Thanks regards Hey Ken You make a great job thank you Hey Ken how would I use a combination of models Hi Ken This was such a great video I really enjoy your videos I have a question I am grade student and I am an aspiring data scientist I have been doing lots of research about the field and I started taking free courses online I want to know what you will suggest me to study in my undergraduate to become a successful data scientist Thank you and Keep up the work Big fan of more LinkedIn reviews in the future Danny is always posting great stuff It's great that you have included LinkedIn in your reviews Although I am a beginner in Data Science and whole Analytics thing but still I would like my GitHub and LinkedIn to be reviewed Hi Ken I just found your channel as I have been searching abt Data Science a lot I am currently working as a Corporate Banker in the field of Digital Banking Fintechs I have a Tech Bachelor degree and a MBA in Finance I want to learn DS AI and want to switch to such career How do I take it ahead Pls guide me Great reviews as always D Personally I struggle the most on optimizing my LinkedIn profile so it is definitely interesting to see good examples would love to see more Oh and btw Your new environment with the monitor and the flower looks really nice Also I know its not your niche to talk about news but I'm curious about what you're thoughts on GPT is Hey Ken what are your thoughts about having a page resume called CV's in places like the UK where I am Entry level Data scientist Don't manage their time well Pro Data scientists Buy clocks Great video as always dude Can I ask what monitor you use for doing work Been thinking about saving for an UltraWide Zeus Hey Ken I have a question When one makes a project for a company they work in using the company's confidential data etc How does one publishes it or add it to their portfolio Should one change the data Like names and labels Or one should just not publish any project related to confidential data of any company and just make projects using open source data The brightness is very high I cant see the wall clocks Special thanks again to Thinam for submitting his work If you would like to have your projects resume or linkedin reviewed in the future please comment below and email me at kenjee ds gmail com Hi Ken I would love to eventually become a data scientist but I don't know if I am smart enough In your opinion do you need to be far above average intelligence to be a data scientist Or would you say its doable with average or slightly above intelligence and a strong sense of curiosity willingness to learn persistence etc We do lot of projects as a biostatistics student like regression trees and random forests can I put these class projects in github too Or should I just focus on posting projects outside classes please do more of these Man this is just a fantastic video Thank you so much Take care This is so helpful Ken thanks a lot Hey Ken I'm from India I still have three left until the completion of my college degree I just now learnt python I wanna purse my career in data science so where should I start from Thank you Sir which MacBook should I buy for data science learning in budget I've been preparing my github website and LinkedIn to finally get the confidence to ask to get a review Ken jee thats a good review to make us understand what should we do n dont Thanks for interesting video Its great you added LinkedIn now I think I would share mine too KEN I LOVE your work im like on my new data science journey doing a month bootcamp with General assembly in Data science What would be the order of your videos like a newbie like me should pay attention to I'm interested First of all Thanks Ken for this and secondly it's a request if you can make a dedicated video on how data analysis can work in cricket I know you may not be knowing about the game but I really want to implement some data analysis into the game of cricket so just need your help and it will do great if you make a video on the same Have a good day mate Great video Thank you Ken I really appreciate your time and effort So happy to have found this channel It's like I found a mentor Thanks for the videos Great stuff Thanks Can you make a video discussing tableau Apache Superset or similar type soft considering their application importance Really appreciate your hard work Thinum Tamang Hey Since many data science jobs these days require masters degree I'm planning to take one But my Bachelor's is in physics and I didn't take many cs DS related class I had only taken an computer programming intro computational physics intro Didn't take linear algebra or such Any tips how to take Master's degree in DS with my background i'm interested What are the temperature cpu package for this build idle and at full load A video on how to respond when one of your projects doesn't go to plan would be great Do you just forget it ever happened Or do you put it on your CV anyway even though you didn't get any inspiring results Learned a lot from this series Ken Thank you soo much and hope you will add more projects like this in the future Can you take up a really messy dataset and guide us on the cleaning part as a video Hypothesis testing is basically all of inferential statistics Which specific tests are most often used by practicing data scientists how about 'deepmonster' sir which is best for data visualization Python or Tableau Just finished watching the video and taught of a budget and when I saw the price of TITAN RTX its price was to times more And then taught its okay I will use my gb ram and gb graphics card for deep learning hope so one day gotta build PC like this expensive A new day and now let's see video what to do when you model takes moths to train Kidding Name Bok Beast of Ken Bok Is months sufficient to learn data science considering I put hours per day daily I have seen a lot of schools offer a business analytics degree with some data science type of classes Would this work Also I have a PhD but my study was qualitative Does this matter Hi Ken what's the purpose of log norm the fare And why we need to scale the 'Age' 'SibSp' 'Parch' 'norm fare' Since you live in Chicago I would go with Monster of the Midway I know we didn't sign any contract lol but it is a big honor being your student i'm learning so much from you thank you so much really Thank you please keep consentrating your content for beginners and fresher Your exlanation really helpful cant find it anywhere Thank you such I'm lost and your content is just guiding me I want to do field measurements on athletes Hi you can use a grid search for optimal parameters to optimize the times processing or Stochastic grid search Thanks for sharing finally I found someone interset to config and Deep learning thank you so much how about OS Windows or Linux which better Sadly the Captain did NOT survive Where can i get the wallpaper Hi ken I got problem after execute the code it said that 'x out failed' can u suggest me what's wrong with my code Not gonna lie when I first saw the Name of the video I thought this was about some kind of kegel exercise I have a question I have a good understanding of python Should I learn numpy and matploylib before starting with like a book on data science or I can begin and learn as I move on Thanks to you From two weeks I was confused where to start in kaggle keep it up Hey Ken I really appreciate every suggestion of yours I have a question though that I do want to learn AI but for that I first need to start coding please let me know where can I start from scratch Hi Ken I enjoy your videos thanks for helping me on my data scientist journey Name your PC Kobe after the late great Kobe Bryant Wow I'm amazed by this Just completed the dog vision project in Daniel's course Throughout the course I've dreamt to one day become as proficient as him Turns out that he didn't know much about computers just four years ago I need to improve our find excuses than a non programming background now The thumbnail is scary indeed As for someone not too keen on computer science and still learning recently how viable is data science as a career for someone like me Remember still pretty new to the idea not computer science it self My freshman year my courses revolve around more of an actuary field macro micro calc stats and intro to comp sci I plan to transfer out next yr hopefully and if I get into one of my choices my major will most likely be operations research financial Engineering computational finance What would be guidance word of advice for someone like me if I did pursue a more data science track instead for a career I just sent an email I hope you pick mine for one of the coming videos THIS MAN IS LIVING HIS BEST LIFE I'm very young and I've been learning a lot of programming for many months I had already started when I was but nowadays I feel more enthusiastic than before This kind of videos are really helpful and motivating Thanks I could only manage step and so far BinFin for binary finery is my suggestion for your rig's name What OS or OSes are you going to use Hey Ken Just love your content dude I am I just wanted you to ask How to keep consistency I love this field and currently learning python I like it But it gets intimidating there is so much more to learn and know How do I keep going I know it's a long journey How did you keep the patience and consistency I already know programming in python And am interested in data science Can u suggest what to do next Like do I need to learn about machine learning and deep learning and neural networks in that order or if not then which order is more preferable In the age of can I learn data science and also I will get job Ken name it Ashwathama Its a hindu mythological god Its a man as well an elephant So both characteristics of man and beast Good luck This Video is really good but it does not give hours tweets Do you know which one is the cheapest Masters Data Science school wow u actually took the time to answer every single question what a boss samaritan Hey Ken This was a fun video I d say you name it Stormbreaker since your last computer was named after Thor s hammer Call it TITANIC It should be called CPU and let the viewer be surprised Ken Turn on CPU Frn ok Frn woaahhhhhhhh just choose python and use jupyter notebook better for begginers you should name it Yeager It's from Attack on Titan anime I think you should name this beast TANZEN cheers Anton Call it Saturn V after the rocket that was used in the Apollo missions Without such a powerful vehicle that was so well crafted humanity wouldn t have been able to get to the Moon and make that great step I feel that this computer could mean something similar to you in terms of hardware I'm doing a course on Machine Learning I would it's intermediate level I'm also looking at data science but honestly I'm not sure what I'm gonna do or what I want to do I'm just learning whatever makes sense and I think I'll figure it out Datsmon or DTSJee or DataJee i have problem with glassdoor scrapper module it said that there is no module in there what should i do about that You should call it Shredder because it will shred the data Is it possible to release these podcasts on spotify GKen as There's your name Acronym for Global Knowledge Exchange Network Maajin Buuu I think Storm breaker as it will coincide with your previous build and will also justify with that white colored chassis By the your workstation looks amazing looking forward to more projects on it Best wishes Amazing workstation and NVIDIA really got stuff to work on I will suggest the name Predator or as you are sports analytics I will suggest Jordan Beast or Bolt mjolnir nice i like that hammer a lot its like there is life in it since this is a upgrade to new faster and stronger PC name it stormbreaker haha or DataSmasher etc bro your videos are very helpful please suggest me how do I increase my data preprocessing data analysis skills few tips How about Nix simple yet edgy Great video How do you think coding challenges play into this I am more computer science focused and just graduated and have been spending my time solving online coding challenges on hackerrank and such Do you consider this inferior to coding projects or also a good way to learn Zamasu from the Dragon ball super series Cool Enzo because that thing is as fast as a Ferrari You Guys are the best name it Jee Jee Name it ODIN The Shredder or The Reaper will be the perfect name This playlist is very good Best way to learn Ken i have question Can a mechanical engineer student apply for masters in data science colleges in uk canada europe Haha I was expecting a Henry Cavill build video lol Also is that a Cotopaxi sweater Great video If you're a portal fan you can call it GLaDOS Well Hela destroyed Mjolnir and Surtur overpowered Hela aaand he is kind of a beast SURTUR You can name it Thanos it will erase training time in half Ken Jee nius Thanks Ken I just got my physics degree and i want to become a data scientist Your videos are helping a lot Thanks Call it Roberto You should just name it Uchiha Madara then Awesome Name it Leviathan Behemoth Nicklaus at Night Kronos or zeus Stormbreaker Snow White would be a cool name I love it how you mention everything in the description of the video too Loving your channel YouTuber of the YEAR Thank you for this This was my dabble in data science and I may not have understood all of what you did but I'm happy I tried it Where should I go from here I am thinking about taking the data science bootcamp course on Udemy Well this is what I call an original intro D This really made me excited to watch the rest of the video And as for the name Since you already went the for the nordic route how about the name ''Valkyrie'' I think it would be a great follow up to Mj lnir D What does that mean Going to deep Learning tutorials for begineers with python and real life scenario problems Man you gotta shoot in higher FPS Maybe or frames per second and your slow motion will look way smoother cleaner and cinematic Check out Mark Bone's channel he has a video called WHY fps IS OVERUSED FRAME RATE GUIDE fps The beginning of the video the slow motion looked unnatural Great video senior In Kaggle which tool is mostly used for the competitions or lessons R or python or both Oisin Brannock Love your videos Ken I ve never seen anyone who both shares my passion of golf and data science keep it up dude Balls Deep My little war machine lmao love that meme I'd call it 'DeLorean' because it's so fast that it can travel time by actually saving your time I hope you like it Moana bc you are from Hawaii lol jk How about PERCEPTRON Good stay that way dude you're gonna be playing cyberpunk on ultra high in k and fps on that machine that's crazy Name it DataSlayer lol Leo That last part of the video though xD I like to be more into how software works there advancement printed circuit making an advanced software etc so BTech in computer science with ai and machine learning would be apt for me My suggestion Lena If I took b tech in computer science with ai and machine learning will I be able to break into data science Hopper or Jeevice Invented from JarviceTexas Supercomputer Hope you like it You can easily overclock that RAM in case you need extra power LOL The VERGE call out Frost Titan might be a cool name Kaggle since you love the courses Hulk if u like pokemon u can name as 'Raikou' its one of the most powerful pokemon which has amazing electric power ur gpu remind me of raikou haha Hands down my favorite video of yours hey Ken Jee call it Rocketrain your models will be training at rocket speed now hehehe Beast is here Ken Jee Call it Beast of the Depths I would name it Honey Badger the most badass creature with no natural predators Great channel Linked Subscribed Do you have books recommendations for the ML concepts Most books I found explain how to code but I'm more interested in the math stats behind those concepts Thank you Name it as VIVAN means intelligent The name should be RT Rex to beat the dinosaure game when your internet crashes Hey bro i will name this pc as susanoo from Naruto reference since susanoo fights on your behalf I also would like to know if we do a sli of or will the performance be greater or a single powerful card is ok for deep learning Currently i dont need this much power but its for the future TAIJEE or TIJEE Holy crap What a beast I might get some of your parts when building my own PC Explanation of the name got the name from the martial art tai chi and I mixed it with Titan the GPU Tiger one of the beast animals and your last name Jee lol Nice video Ken sweet build damn that Titan is clean GhostCat Anyway your build is super awesome D Thanks for another great video Ken It was really fun to watch this video I would like to suggest the name TIZEN TI from TITAN and ZEN from RYZEN that can also be called TIZEN the Beast Inspired from the name of Mike Tyson and his nickname The Beast Its white and its a beast Fenrir a white wolf Also just wondering regarding the choice of CPU Doesn't ryzen cpu's have problem with intel compilers which significantly reduces performance Name it THANOS as he beat up thor in infinity war pretty bad You are a hope to all aspiring data scientists Sycamore Using the company's state of the art quantum computer called Sycamore Google has claimed quantum supremacy over the most powerful supercomputers in the world by solving a problem considered virtually impossible for normal machines You are a good hardware engineer I would recommend Zenitsu as name How about 'Everest' New heights and all that jazz Computer name Katy reminds me of Roar by Katy Perry Nice PC btw Hello Sir I'm a student whose currently studying in class th and I've chosen the career path of a Data Scientist Your channel is actually the first channel I've ever subscribed to because from the first video that I saw on your channel about whether one should choose a bootcamp a certificate or a masters' degree I've been hooked to your channel and have seen most of your videos First of all thank you for making them its extremely difficult to find any person on youtube or otherwise that provides such comprehensive guides it really helps aspiring data scientists like me a lot Secondly I'd like to ask you whether I should aim for a CS undergraduate degree or a DS one I've seen a plethora of videos and then I've realized that at present the CS is the go to degree however the shift of preference from CS to DS is occurring and I'm trying to think ahead that when I graduate would a DS degree increase my chances of getting hired or would the norm still remain CS I'd be extremely grateful if you could provide some insight into this As for the name of your new beast of a machine I'd suggest the name Kronos from Greek mythology the Titan of Time I'm a fan of Percy Jackson and other works of Rick Riordan Kronos would probably be the perfect name because You said at the start your build was made around your gpu the rtx TITAN so for the computer to share a name with an actual Titan from mythology would be pretty cool Seeing the specs I'm sure this machine will be crazy fast and that'll result in much faster response times and code compilation times seeing that time is such an essential aspect here it makes the name Kronos even more fitting since he was the Titan of Time The age of the Titans is called the Golden Age in greek mythology seeing that your graphics card is also golden i think it makes perfect sense Once again thank you making these videos they really are a huge help PS I hope you like my name and the reasoning I gave Maybe name it Imperiex It's a DC Vilan I am concerned about the Math part Some insights on that area will be really helpful Please advise It's name should be BeastoComputa Can I learn deep learning on Macbook Pro Call it JARVIS Name it Fugaku Name Samurai Call it Haietlik It's a mythological creature Lightning Serpent They are described as huge serpents with heads as sharp as a knife and tongues that shoot lightning bolts From Wikipedia You know Cause Python Maybe name it Cronus one of the Titans from Greek mythology since the center of the build is the Titan RTX nice devbox Name it THE KITTEN It purrs like a one What an awesome workstation Hope I could get one I am also a big fan of AMD and never get disappointed by its performance durability and obviously the price The name I suggest is Saturn since Titan is Saturn's largest moon Since you are calling it a beast what better then the 'Kraken' itself Name it JEEzus Po should be the name From kung fu panda Because of it's black white look and it's a panda and a beast you know right panda pandas right How about X A Cheetah Drago call it Mark Harpe or Cronus Cronus was one of the Titans of Greek mythology and the Harpe was his weapon fashioned by Gaia Wolverine Call it Dr Zola How about Bruce The computer name has to be Benetton you should name it Better than the verge build Call the PC Masamune DataWeaver or Zeus one of the most powerful gods greek myth Name The JEENATION Treat your as your buddy and name it Scooby Doo Or Gunther Thanks for watching everyone Remember to comment below with your name for my new computer The best name will win a Jetson Nano NVIDIA TITAN RTX Details https nvda ws ViJVx Awesome work station Damn that's a beast and the verge is now a level of very bad in PC building community xD You should name this new computer Stormbreaker That or Gungnir I like the Norse Mythology inspired naming theme you had for your first one Edit Or if you're looking for something else Godzilla could be a cool name Final answer though is Stormbreaker Keeping with the same theme StormBreaker PC name Money Check Need for Autonomy Check Creativity Check Uncomfortable with Collaboration Failed I personally struggle in driving others to deliver These are in sights with great clarity Thanks a lot I got in my favour The rd is something we can learn Why did so many ppl dislike this Going through projects step by step pointing out the nuance is helping me A LOT Wooow just diving into this video but what a great series idea Endless content created by others who are willing participants the coding virus has spread and isn t stopping as more people dive in videos in this series and your channel by extension will explode All of this is miles above my head but I m slowly getting it Thanks Ken Hi Ken any tips for freshers I am Indian how can I apply for data science job in foreign country if I am fresher b tech batch Dude you really helped spark a passion for data science in me Thank you The hardest part was always knowing where to start Hey Ken I am facing a problem while importing glassdoor scraper Hope to hear a solution from you about it You are a hero man You saved my ass Thanks alot Thank You So Much From Morocco Keep Going So much applicable useful information in this video thanks again Ken I just graduated with my Bachelors and always thought data science was interesting and that it was the path I was going to aim towards But recently with the low amount of entry level DS positions available and the overwhelming amount of material to know I have been debating on changing career paths I definitely underestimated the level of knowledge and expertise you need in order to be in this field Watching this video has helped me realize that maybe it isn't the right fit for me I am personally uncomfortable with autonomy mainly because I haven't had any prior work experience I definitely have a lot to consider Thank you for sharing Hi Ken i have done a bunch of courses online and from some DS bootcamp how do i gain experience with the knowledge i possess in readiness for a job interview Is that an oura ring Thank you Ken for the honest helpful information I am starting my journey into data science and this was very helpful is it possible to get live game scores for ongoing or recent matches in real time Hello really appreciate your efforts I'm ML beginner done with only theory algorithms no hands on experience yet How should I start and from where Need few suggestions Eric is great Love his LinkedIn posts Great video Ken Thanks Ken for this amazing podcast really enjoyed the discussion I totally agreed on sharing data science work socially As a researcher sharing my data science work on has opened several doors of opportunities For one people who see the work that I share socially may reach out to me with opportunities to apply for research grants to take part in awesome collaborative research projects to take part in editorial roles in research journals prospective students reach out to join our research group serve as the starting point for collaborative discussions to serve as external examiners of PhD dissertation etc As a YouTuber I learn a lot from the subscribers questions suggestions feedbacks tips and tricks etc collaborate and engage in discussions with other awesome YouTubers such as Ken Jee Krish Naik Dhaval Patel Jay Feng Jaemin Lee etc Aside from this the act of sharing is like paying it forward Imagine if we all share the collective intelligence of all the awesome ideas and works would serve as amazing resource to learn get inspired and create further awesome data science work Hi Ken at when checking the multiple linear regression summary for variables that has either very small coef slope is close to zero or p values smaller than statistically not significant can we safely remove them from the regression model legends and both do BJJ please make a full project vidoes on Deep Learning it will be helpfull to our journey to Data Science Sir I have a confusion I want to ask which is better an online certification course on data science or a year degree program How much time it takes to become an industry ready data scientist Just a Quick question Should I I'm from non technical background be doing competitive programming and algos in Hackerrank or Github to learn and excel in Data science Thanks your videos are very helpful Thank you for your video it was so much helpful and insightful I'm happy that I watched your video thank a lot for the video i want to know how to use python to dowland tweets and how i use them to analyse the sentiments by using getoldtweets package Do you think I can get a job in data analytics from commerce background without a traditional studying approach i e a degree Love this As a pragmatist I find it appalling how intimidating this field appears before you start diving in and getting your hands dirty Hopefully people can start to understand that DS is human intuition applying math and computing as a tool but not a concept separate from real word problem solving I recently read something about digital footprints don't remember where but there's a brazilian video that talks about it https www youtube com watch v qb yXWFRROg t s It talked about how anything you do or post online maybe a github account or a comment on stackoverflow anything that can help the world see you is efficient the important thing is to do somehting Sooner or later opportunities will come Great video Ken A suggestion I think it would be nice to talk about foreigners trying to enter the data science market in your case in the U S How it's possible advices maybe stereotypes or if there is much prejudice Think it's a nice subject What sarkar pls come again Great content like always David Perell wrote about the concept of 'serendipity vehicle' in one of his blog posts where he explains the importance of sharing your work on the internet It goes hand in hand with what you explained Great video This video hit really deep personally I have been thinking for a few months now that I should show my work more I though about starting a YouTube channel or a blog because I think it would be a lot of fun doing so Especially when Eric said that everyone has a personal brand and your choice is not if you want one or not but if you want to actively take part in shaping your brand or not this really made me reconsider the way I think about showing my work I now feel even more motivated to start sharing my work more Thank you for this video Thanks for the informative video I just wanted to know whether octave platform is useful or jupyter notebooks are much effective for data science ML Thanks for watching everyone You can learn more about Eric on his linkedin https www linkedin com in eric weber b All videos that talk about Data Science are basically git gud Sharing your work opens up more opportunities Thanks ken never used Kaggle or even done any data science projects The detailed analysis including the nuances MOST IMPORTANTLY is really making this digestible not to mention applicable Hello Ken It's amazing how your channel has been growing I'm looking forward to expand my DS knowledge Are there any books text books you would recommend for learning Data Science Thanks Can you please tell from where should i study mathematics for data science Thank you sir for this great content Hey Ken Currently I'm learning Data Science but soon I want to learn Deep Learning and Machine Learning too Which one should I go to first And what should be the areas I should cover in those I'm totally unaware of these topics Thank You Great content Can you do a video for soccer Hi Ken This year i will go to college and i'm between a Data Science degree and Computer Science degree I want to pursue a career in Data Science I already now some languages of programming mainly Python JS C and a bit of R but i'm afraid that the programming aspect that the Data Science degree has will not be sufficient for the future and also i'm afraid that the Computer Science degree will not give the necessary skills for a data science career such as analysis statistics etc I'd like to know if you think that a Data Science degree is worth it or if a Computer Science is better Thank you and i love your content keep it up Amazing video I hope you do a similar video on regression and clustering problems in the future Is data science a subset of AI If I want to become an AI app developer do I have to start with data science Hi Ken I would love if you review my resume I just sent you one in email Hello sir I am Akash from india currently doing my graduation in science Once I get to know about field of data science after that I am just researching about this field Now I made my mind to draw my career in data science So please assist me regarding me about the scope of this field How can I be successful in this field Hey Ken thank you so much for the great videos Would you rather suggest to improve Python skills after some first projects or change the main focus on other recommended languages like SQL Im now a junior majoring in finance Can I still become a data scientist if I get a masters in business analytics or data science Thanks Ken Which resume template would you recommend Do you have any tips for high schoolers interested in data science Bro I have a doubt I am interested in CV and NLP but not interested in linear regression kinda stuff Can I learn CV and NLP from the beginning itself I want to analysis some data on people reaction over Facebook in COVID pandemic Will you kindly suggest me some project on it that will be very helpful for me All the Best for Ryder Cup Your channel has been popping in my feed this last week Great content Ken it inspires me to keep pursuing a career in DS I'm a statistician Hey I am a new fork I just want to know what can be considered as a good score for this problem I scored And I see thousands of people with score of perfect So just confused Please help me with you thoughts Hey Ken great video as usual I wanted to let you know that I got the job in downtown Chicago at a finance company but I have some questions I start in weeks and in that time I want to do some finance projects but kaggle doesn t have that many I was wondering if you could recommend some finance projects datasets that I could practice on Thank you Hey ken I have been watching your videos for at least hour a day the past week and I love the content I m and am beginning my journey towards my career in data science sports analytics and your content has by far been the best I ve come across I was wondering if there was an email that I could contact you with Or would you prefer Lengthy YouTube comments instead Either way thanks again for the free content it s very appreciated This is great walkthrough for beginner like me Thanks Ken Jee This series really is giving me such a confident boost with the provided tips that I'm learning Heyyy ken jee You data professor krish naik and codebasics are doing an excellent work and helping many data aspirants from the world to get their life settle Thank you for all of this That's good information Thank you so much Thanks Ken once I have finished learning the fundamentals midway through online course and Kaggle courses will get these done your videos are very helpful I prefer using both sometimes its just exiciting if you have tools that Can close the disadvantages of another tools I used R for analyzing data and it's easy to do many statistical testing than python in my opinion but remember you also need to know SQL and hadoop for this data science Hi Ken great video Thank you Please consider making a similar video with panel data Thank You Short and sweet Thank u I clicked the like button right before you mentioned it I found this video at the perfect time I'm at that stage where I realize how much I don't know and feeling overwhelmed and that I'll never be able to recall all of the information I've been learning It's great to know that I'm on the right track and doing the same thing with how I am organizing my notes New mantra It's not shameful that I can't remember everything Thanks for taking the time to review my resume I hope that you continue on giving insightful advice to help more people get into this industry Hi Ken I am a Mechanical Engineer for seven years I don t have a lot of experience in programming or data science I am looking at taking Bootcamp for Data Sciences at USC but it is an offer by Trilogy I got into the program within two days of applying I try to do research for the validity of the certificate and statistic of the students who would get a job in data science after the programs I don t find a lot of information I am wondering if my best bet is to go to a Master's Degree in Data Sciences Any intro stats online courses for total beginners I think the point you make around is a really good one in general for all forms of science and engineering It's really about practice at the end of the day We're not born math geniuses we learn math through repetition and problem solving Same thing applies to data science and programming The more you practice it the better you get and little by little the overwhelming problems seem a little less overwhelming What's the exact difference between a Machine Learning Engineering vs Data Scientist Long time no comment exam period came quick D Awesome review s I just took some time to catch up on your uploads and I noticed that your recording your background and your thumbnails have upgraded It was also really great seeing you collaborate with other people in the community One question I always had about your channel is why you had this golf wallpaper as your channel banner But after watching the previous videos I learned why which was cool to know D Video just shows you don't need to have great hair to be a data scientist Thanks for watching everyone Comment below if you would like me review your project portfolio or resume Please also send an email to kenjee ds gmail com Hey Would you mind making a video on data science resumes for freshers who are seeking for either an internship or a full time job Another great video Ken Awesome insights on crafting the perfect resume Hi Ken I have to predict a binary classification the dataset has two columns with monetary information both have right skewed distribution If i scale columns and or apply log transformations accuracy gets worse Why could that be Even by removing outliers percentile or it also gets worse Thanks Sir I want you to also review data science internship Resumes too I'm doing a virsual internship that data professor mentioned in which section should I put it my resume Thanks so much ur videos have helped me very much for my data science career Cool Thank you master bruno Mars Heyy first here After your last video I started working with Titanic data would love to share it with you and would like to know your opinion once I am done with it is regression or classification harder I don't know which one I should start learning first In stats we only learned regression and never classification Thanks Good info hey ken I'm facing trouble regarding salary all the salaries in the data frame are the same as the first one can u help Loving this video and the thumbnail dude Thanks for the content Ken but SSD stands for solid state drive not stead y You doing excellent job Sir Hi Ken thanks for the help on learning about data science I struggle a lot using Kaggle to learn python The user experience for me is quite intimidating compared to other platforms I used as there are times even when I know the question I get lost on how to answer and follow the steps Thank you for the great video It's very helpful This may seem like a silly question but how much should I expect to retain in my calculus and statistics knowledge gained from math classes once I am actually working in the field Should it be expected that I could whip open any calculus textbook and solve a any math problem without having to look at notes I only ask this because when looking at advanced calculus videos on YouTube it makes me wonder how I will ever be able to retain all what I've learned especially when I begin learning differential equations exterior derivatives pull backs and other advanced topics which as of now seem like a foreign language to me Hi Ken your videos are really helpful for beginners like me Can you do a similar walk through video for House Prices problem as well thanks in advance Ken I really love what you do on your channel I hope you don't mind but I've mentioned your channel on my first Medium article about my story posted here https medium com davidlee my inspirational journey in starting data science with no code experience through weeks of a You can delete my post as I'm not trying to self promote here Thank you for what you do man I'm starting bootcamp tomorrow while learning from your channel as well You re a LEGEND Ken I only discovered your channel today and I am HOOKED I started learning to code in python weeks ago and am starting my first k means clustering project with a dataset about penguins today Thanks to your videos and introducing me to Kaggle I m feeling so much less terrified Keep up the amazing content I feel so motivated thanks to you so relatable Hi why did you type training train test test 'train test' test 'survived' np NaN Love your content man Keep it up k subs is just around the corner Amazing analogy I'll definitely borrow this when I need to explain what data science is Looking forward to more videos like this It's incredibly helpful to get an experienced viewpoint on how to think about and dissect these sorts of problems You have saved us hours of self exploration Thank you Ken D Hope you can make more videos like this Great stuff Ken thanks for sharing First went through a couple of minutes of the video where you discussed what had to be done and started solving it by my own Once I was done came back here to check out how you'd solved This was immensely helpful as my code was not as efficient and learnt better approaches to the same problem Thanks Ken I followed this video of yours and started with course from both Kaggle and Google along with a blog Thanks for the advice https machinelearning wordpress com blog Do suggest anything else that I can improve or work over Excellent job Hey Ken why you prefer spyder than Jupiter notebook which one I should go for any suggestions Hey Ken I have recently did my submission for this topic on KAGGLE I got a score of on my nd second submission using KNN for classifying I have submitted my notebook under the title TOP USING KNN I want to score above Can you please check and like give me feedback about how I did and what I should improve on I think it would be great if you could show how you would present this project in a markdown file in order to add it to your github Thanks for the great work Hi Ken I know this is not a correct forum to ask this but still https stackoverflow com questions creating a new corpus with nltk nlp can you help me with this thanks in advance I've been learning data science for months and I've been clearing my stats and r concepts and learning ml algos and after than I wanna jump into dl nlp ai though I'm from commerce background but I personally like it Hello Thanks for the video I heard you told about deep learning for this dataset included categorical and non categorical features It is a typical data that we usually see Could you please make a video and build a deep learning model Hello Ken Jee I have Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and I'm currently working as an engineer for piping company I am also doing master's degree online in IT I'm eventually trying to get into Data Science Is getting AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialty certification good enough to land a Data Science job considering I have a master's degree in IT This is incredible Thanks Thanks Really appreciate the breakdown Looking into exploring into DS and this has been the best breakdown of the pro and cons if each option Thanks Ken I d be super interested in seeing you competing in a real Kaggle Competition thanks for the advice i ll start learning python right now the quality of the video would be xbetter at least for me if you look right to the camera when speaking idk maybe im weird but i feel it makes a big difference thanks again Interesting I was wondering how representative this approach is Querying ' CaptailMarvel' would only pull up a portion of the overall Twitter conversation on the movie as most casual users don't use hashtags in that way You're likely looking at a sample of mostly media tweets Doesn't devalue the analysis of course great work I really enjoy both interviews I remember back then in the end of when I decided to study ML by my own during my master in physics Daniel's channel got my motivated inspired and informed about the online courses out there Today I work as a Data Scientist in an amazing company that produce plant based foods trying to imitate animal products using artificial intelligence I recently found your channel Ken and it have very honest advices and great material to people that want to start in Data Science and also people in the industry already Thanks to both of you guys PD Can you share the podcast with Elon Musk values count you used for excel is 'aws' copy and paste editing error I think you meant to say df excel values count Otherwise lambda made simple here Please could you do videos on lambda Otherwise great video as always so much to pick up Thank you Thanks a lot which master degree would you suggest and university for data science Your channel is a gold mine for me keep it up Hello I am week into learning Python Sorry for this dumb question but is data science part of machine learning Is it possible to learn coding languages at once when they are very different Excellent content thanks I want to learn python and then move up my way to AI ML Anyone encountered the ElementClickInterceptedException Message element click intercepted Element div class tab data test tab data tab type overview div is not clickable at point Other element would receive the click p id onetrust policy text p Session info chrome how can you do that in visual studio code i put the code but nothing is happening May I know the best laptop for data scientist Guys my CSS is not rendering any one could help me Thank you Ken Jee and Data Professor for bring that kind of content Very enlightening to hear from someone with Daniel's background As a recent biomedical science graduate and nutrition fitness obsessive I identify with this story to an uncanny degree Only difference is I eventually got into medicine and only now started with coding machine learning impressive work so much to learn thanks for doing this Ken keep up the hard work I have a MSc Mathematics Statistics Been trying to land a job in the stats field since I graduated but no luck Thinking of taking data science to become a data analyst Planned to take a Master's degree in Data Science but have to forego because there's no scholarship available due to this horrid pandemic Just started a free data science online course on Kaggle My question is am I on the right path Is it really possible for me to become a data analyst through this path Hope you can share your insight I'm so desperate tbh because I just lost my job recently due to this horrible pandemic Hey Ken can you tell me how cloud computing is connected with data science and from where to start for this field I went to indeed and started researching the local job market Nashville for data scientists Every job required a MS in data science I immediately can to YouTube and found your video My intent was to take Harvard's online DS certificate program due to its low cost Base on what you said in this video I am just going to scrap the idea of becoming a data scientist You confirmed what I found in my job research on indeed I am a mechanical engineer and I also have a degree physics I assumed that this would be a seamless transition I currently make figures in my current role I am not looking to take a hit in salary for an super entry level job as a data scientist if I can even land this role due to the requirements employers are looking for SMH back to the drawing board You re content is always top class Ken As a beginner in this field you ve taught me so much through your videos Please keep them coming The best guy to motivate that nothing is impossible you only need the determination to do it I don't understand who are these people to dislike If you can't support him stop disliking him at least someone is putting in efforts to make knowledge and learning process easy what is the problem of you dislikers thanks for this video Thanks a lot ken jee Ken Jee can we do a data science project on anime Hey Ken Amazing video Where did you learn the feature engineering I am always stuck in that part of the projects Udacity or Coursera to gain valuable data science knowledge Literally was looking at this today I am glad that I came across your channel Always wanted to try titanic dataset on kaggle but didn't now I m gonna try it thanks This video came at such good timing I just taught myself python and started the titanic project today but was feeling so unsure about everything Thank you for your videos Did you make a chatbot which automatically replies to every comment Hey Ken Nice video how old were u when u started your data science career I know it s a weird question to ask but still I am little curious to know as I am currently planning to shift my career into Data science field I am years old and working in Project management Also I have a bachelors in Mechanical engineering which i think is far away from data science I like your monitor Is it for gaming or good for everyday use too Love your videos Ken They are no nonsense and stick to just DS Your content is well made up and your voice is clear Thanks for sharing your knowledge I am sure with such quality content you will soon hit k subscribers and more Amazing i learn a lot with your videos thanks for sharing your knowledge hug from Argentina Since you made a confession at the beginning Imma hit you with one myself I'm been trying to study DS consistently for a year and half and bruh I find it incredibly frustrating I do not feel particularly smart enough to do projects on my own but I really like your content so I will stick around Thanks Ken I'm working on the same competition and that was super helpful Quick Q I'm trying to build up my DS portfolio do you think it's worth my time to do the whole thing from scratch i e EDA feature engineering modelling and to dwell a bit more on the theoretical stuff Put another way is it more important in these types of projects to show knowledge of how these models actually work or to show that you can use tools and libraries like sklearn proficiently I sense a rising Kaggle Grandmaster in the future Great job Thank you so much Sadly I have some work at college and couldn't finish the video but I will definitely come back to it hopefully next week Great video dude exactly what i was looking for its really great to see creators actually listening to the audience and working on it Keep it up pal Solid advice my man This video was extremely helpful I have been searching the internet for a video that would walk me through this exact project Your videos are the best keep up the good work Can you make a video direct me to a video on how to prepare for a masters degree in data science This is just great I've been following your videos for a while now and making my way through all the microcourses on Kaggle This is the exact video I was looking for to begin the next stage of learning by diving into some data science projects Top content and keep up the great work Ken Aw kaggle series here we goooo Great job Please do these sort of videos more often Man great video I'm starting on data science and this hands on project explanation was super helpfull Is it possible to do these in R It was a very insightful explanation of this project really liked it And at cell if you execute training describe include all it will also give you the values which appear the most for every categorical variable Which I think can be really helpful Thank GOD and thank you very much for your support and time I am using recycling aluminum cans and plastic bottles I know there's several nuggets to be expressed but I don't have a clue on how to express this information to a website Do you have ANY ideas or suggestions Let me know This was much needed Thank you very much l Thank Ken Jee For spending your time during this lockdown for educating youngsters like us Hi ken Great Video I just completed your part data science from beginning series I am a beginner in data science and your video helped me a lot Thanks Thank You Ken for providing this video your new subscriber from India Hi Ken This is really very informative for me as a newbie in DS Glad to see that as comfortable as you are using the lambda instead of RegEx with this one to clean up data yet had to google how to drop a column I thought that was very cool that you didn't edit it out and makes me feel better Very encouraging keep up Thanks a lot for sharing Nice insights Ken Jee In fact I remember working with this dataset in my early days of ML Thanks Ken I was waiting for this video Good Luck Learned something new VotingClassifier please upload more Kaggle competitions videos It will significantly helps us in our learning journey Thanks Keep up with great the work you've been doing in this channel ken really helping us beginners Hi Ken Please create a separate play list for kaggle videos Thanks a lot Sir this help me a lot to clear my doubts Ken Great video and great initiative Sounds like fun I also haven't done a Kaggle submission yet will follow your path and do one soon Thanks I will try to do this alongside your video D Thank you Ken Doing this first thing in the morning tomorrow Just the notification I was waiting for thanks man Thanks for watching everyone Feel free to upvote the notebook on kaggle if you found it helpful Kaggle notebook https www kaggle com kenjee titanic project example My Kaggle Profile https www kaggle com kenjee I would pay money to see that Brazilian jiu jitsu match Very helpful video Straightforward and very informative Thanks for making this Learning how to learn and breakdown information was one of the best skills I obtained from my academic experience Oddly learning data science has been more rewarding thus far mostly because of being self reliant on myself and becoming independent Not having a syllabus and everything planned laid out in front of you is a skill in itself It is great to be able to obtain the skills regardless of background as long as you put the work in This means a lot to me as someone who was a first gen student and college isn't always attainable or even the right path Now to advocate for internet accessibility across the U S and also the globe Thank you both for the informative interview I will be journaling my progress at the end of the day we all could use some confidence and motivation hello ken sir I am having a consulting firm in india for a costing and taxtion work i have team for the same I want to start now in new field of data science as my firm is set and these is really good analytical field which i will like to work on I find your videos really interesting and showing the way ahead I want to make you my mentor Thanks Regards Deepali India Good video I wonder if it's possible to get a remote internship or job in usa or europe and how to get it Subscribed My goal this week is to finish a project on EDA for a FIFA dataset and learn about Ensemble Technique Super video Super inspiring Only wished that the background music was more calm Abandoned video at Want to know why Read Visit video to get a quick subject and topic list of math required for data science Video suggests article to read on topic Stop video video article Offers link to coursera course on topic Visit coursera course Spend BLOODY minutes trying to find the cost of certification Do not find it give up search frustrated Return here to leave comment Abdandon watching the rest of the video Conjure up images of wanting to punch the wall in frustration on time wasted with results still unfound Comment done Now minutes later I still need a list of subjects and topics Hey Ken great video as always I have been looking for a specific dataset where I can do a project using clustering and classification I have been having trouble finding a good one on Kaggle and GitHub do you have any specific datasets that you recommend beginner intermediate level Thank you so much again for the content your channel has been my main source of guidance on my data science journey I couldn't do it without you In the short term progress disappoints but in the long run it surprises Love it ' thank you for your videos Very useful content Your channel is really helping lives in my school I'm from Nigeria and most of us get into this machine learning thing self taught and your channel has given a lot of insights to this thing and for that I want to say a big THANK YOU Sir I really enjoyed this interview and one thing I notice unique from your other videos and that is your energy your energy was so high interviewing denial and i loved that very much I am currently working on a data science project and was thinking of wrapping it up in a simple Django site more work than Flask but I think worth the effort Do you usually make APIs out of projects Does it sometimes come full circle as a full web app I'm trying to stand out as an applicant Ken Jee I m about to start my senior year of college and I m majoring in physics and math and I m starting to get really interested in data science I m currently working a research internship in medical physics and I m using python with numpy pandas etc to analyze how the accuracy of CT scanners changes from week to week Even though this internship hasn t had me use any physics so far I ve found the analysis very interesting I would really like to get a job in data science without going to graduate school What would you recommend that I do in the next year while I finish up college to best prepare me to land a job I go to Texas A M so we have a huge network but I don t know where to start other than using the kaggle courses I ve tried looking at job postings and it seems like all the jobs require a masters degree and or years of experience Thank you I am from digital marketing now I am migrating to data science is it need to learn statistics great advice I would love a channel like what this guy has made but more specialized in Football European rather than American Sports That's so awesome I've been following both of you for a while I really like how he just explored everything till he found something he liked hey ken can you give me an insight on the language R as you told it is used in sports how is it used in sports it would be a great help Hello Ken thanks for your insight I am a master's degree holder in aeronautical engineering engine propulsion If I were self taught do I have a chance of getting a job in the data science industry Halo ken Am a student of commerce finance option expected to graduate this year Am so hungry for the knowledge of data science please advise on how where I can learn data science and how long it will take me Please reply Inspiring Thanks you really did cover all the topics that I've been looking for Great work Awesome i'm inspired Dang all the nerds doing bjj these days Me included Another query Why do we have to set the variables like odometer and price into specific format or scale them Thanks a lot Daniel Ken for putting it together I do have a question for both of you How do you keep your concentration levels high when you are reading a book cover to cover It's a lot of stuff I tend to lose my interest after reading a book for about hours At the end of the day when I look back I have just skimmed through the pages and I can recall maybe or topics at most Hello Ken How should I'm into digital marketing and interested in web analytics Can you suggest what will be the best path for me I have recently completed a one data science with python project Wow likes and dislikes This interview was very good Waiting for your Kaggle projects video This is extremely useful I realized I was so wrong about some learning approaches and practices I'm a pure beginner Very informative He is Suggesting being Professional NOT FAIR DUDE For more coding stuff subscribe Indieducate Really awesome interview Thank you Ken and Daniel Both of you are really amazing glad to say that i learned hell lot of things from you too looking forward for more colabs You are a lot smarter doing things than you are thinking about things Best quote I'be heard in a long time Thank you for this interview As an Uber driver this has been beyond words inspiring and helpful Is it too old to become ml engineer at this is so dope Daniel is my inspiration in many aspects from learning to health This is two of my favorite AI youtubers colab How good is the course on coursera Data science by IBM We are getting together a group of friends and self teaching ourselves ML right now The Biggest Data Science Crossover to happen Thank you so much for this tutorial it's been the most useful one for my scraper projects so far Honestly if out of is gonna fail then the system is the biggest problem It just means the admissions team didnt do a good job filtering out those who lack a crucial background in bio and the curriculum along with the support system lacks quality A school with a good system would only see drop out rate at most Very very inspiring Thank you for this D Ken I'm not able to get the model as its showing Buffer type mismatch File sklearn tree tree pyx line in sklearn tree tree Tree cinit ValueError Buffer dtype mismatch expected 'SIZE t' but got 'long long' could you please help Been following this channel since I got let go after COVID budget cuts but figured I'd try to turn something bad into a good opportunity and use this time to learn data science but this series is awesome coz it really ties in all the theoretical pieces from the coursework together thank you Around Ken u said we didn't specify a series and we have to let the dataframe know we're doing this on rows I don't get this what does axis do You are too slow and good thing is you share quality content but sometimes i feel sleepy Please make changes in your story telling May be this is the reason why you are not famous in ds but you deserve Hey Ken I want to get good at data science for industrial level how shall I start Awesome video ken Thank you for letting us newbies know what to study and understand I want to learn Data science guide me What do you recommend doing for a review of the interpretability of project outcomes Let s say I m working on an econometrics project on my own what s the best place or way to review that I m drawing the correct conclusions from my results A lot of data science online sources simply take you through the code and the outputs but don t go into how to make sure you re drawing all conclusions from the model Excited for this collab to listen to Daniel's journey Can't wait Looking forward to this Agreed with Joseff this is going to be legendary Hey Ken apart from the Kaggle micro course could you recommend a Coursera course or the like to better understand ML for a beginner Hi i wanted to ask that when I am opening this website on my mobile phone the images are not showing What's the reason behind this Any suggestions would be helpful Watching in July xD Amazing video Ken While practising analysis of a simple dataset if most of the predictors are not statistically significant how do we handle such a scenario Thanks a Lot for this tutorial I am an electronics engineering student I have done a python beginners course on udemy I want to apply in the field of data science Could you please guide me with what my next steps should be Is there a book about soccer analytics you can recommend Another nice video Ken I have a question here Which one is better do we have to put one project in one repository or do we put several projects in one repository For instance this repository is a repository for the projects that I have done by taking a dataset from Kaggle Thank you Ken Hi Ken If I follow along with the project but do it for different cities in India do I have permission to put it on my github or does it class as plagiarism If so I won't be sharing it online Of course I will write about your work link and mention the original idea in the Readme Is it intellectual property theft if done this way Whoaaaa this is gonna be epic Damn excited two fav YouTubers on Colab Been

CS version is what I use but will still have it in other versions They do have spell check You just click on the top menu bar Edit Check Spelling or Ctrl I for the shortcut Coming from an art background I would still advise giving Adobe Illustrator another shot It takes a bit getting used to but you will always have more control with programs like this that are meant for better professional design Great videos love the content This is amazing series thanks it helped me a lot As usual great content and pragmatic tips Thanks for doing this Hoping one day to get my projects reviewed This might be slightly out of place but I have been meaning to ask about your ring It's prominent and elegant and I was wondering where can I get myself one of those P I am studying physics as an undergrad and my growing interest in this field saw its peak when I found out that my university had offered free Coursera access I am currently taking data science related math statistics and Python courses there I aspire to specialize in machine learning since I feel drawn to certain aspects of it I have just found out about your channel thanks to your interview with Tim Bowling and hit the subscribe button I find your videos really helpful Keep up the great work thanx this is useful Loved this video I am excited to share my GitHub as well This went from to real quick SMH Hey Ken just wanted to say you make some amazing content I was also wandering whether you think I should rather complete another Bachelors degree or straight onto a Master in Data Science I've ended up completing my Bachelors in Sport and Exercise Science and am currently the middle of my research project in Biomechanics Although I enjoy the field I feel like my contributions if I stick with it will be limited to academia and find the idea that my articles may rarely ever be looked at quite disheartening If I return to university I was considering completing a bachelor of actuarial studies not quite the same as data science but quite closely related i just Beginner i need to understand how to know Business requirement or how to understand this Business So first we perform data manipulation and cleaning which you taught in the previous videos before linear regression right First great video and definitely a great series Ken In few weeks i will be ready to submit my github Merging all the recommendation given by Ken Jee Can't wait Helo sir I am DHEERAJ KUMAR I have mailed you my GitHub link and Portfolio last month kindly request you to review it sir bhut hi bdiya mere bhai shivam followed ALL the steps to the Tee I get a error Could you please help These videos are incredibly helpful man Thanks a ton from an inspiring data scientist i am on my way to doing my first project and i hope you can review my portfolio then Thank you so much Ken Your video is actually helpful Hey ken Loving the series I wanted to make a suggestion since I don't have a decent portfolio yet to submit it for your analysis I think you should make a series solving actual data science tasks and problems that Data Scientists face daily I think it would be very innovative and reaaaaally helpfull to beginners like me Greeting from Brazil Hey Ken Great video I had confusion about the code for scaling the data Can you explain me how exactly does it work you are the best I'm almost ready to submit my projects portfolio to this series Another great review video Ken Hi sir I am a graduate in computer science and I am learning data science I am an arsenal fan I want to work for them as a data scientist or a junior data scientist or even an as a trainee How can I land a job there My goal for this week finish the SQL datacamp course do one Cornell course of ML each day Hope I can make it Thank you Ken for the feedback I have jotted down all your points and will be working on these in the coming months Anybody who is interesting in learning together by doing some Kaggle Projects as mentioned connect with me on LinkedIn https www linkedin com in shivam jalotra b or shoot me an email jalotrashivam gmail com It would be really great if you reviewed my github Actually for now It is still a student profile But You could show good insights for me and others Oh I'll submit properly in some minutes but if you can look at it right know pauloreis ds Thank you It makes all the difference have a mentor like you Hey bro just wanted to let you know that months of studying later I may have a job lined up I did the interviews and skills tests just waiting on the word Fingers crossed Thanks Ken for another great video Noticed your iPad touchscreen notebook has a mirrored display of your camera Would love to learn what software you're using for that Thanks Ken for sharing my video I agree with you about linking projects on the GitHub profile page That will help employers view your projects more readily loved this mate Nice nice nice I still have my final semester left in undergraduate Can I still apply for DS roles I love your content Special thanks again to Shivam for submitting his github portfolio If you want to have your projects resume or github reviewed please comment below and send your work to kenjee ds gmail com Link to Import Data's github header video is here https www youtube com watch v RDoNJ zGg Can you share the code and the raw data thanks Thanks for the sharing I see the four math area statistic discrete math linear alegbra and calculus required for data science I graduated with management degree and cal is the highest math class i had Is it possible for me to self taught all those math If yes what are the resouces you would recommend me to learn from I wish i study more math back in college but going back to college is not realistic for me now Thanks again for your time and your sharing in video Hey Ken I enrolled in the Data Science course and I was wondering if it would be useful in any way Do you really work a lot with Excel in your Data Science profession Superb dude Thank you Your videos are so informative You brought up a lot of good points and it was nice to see Dos as well as Don'ts I haven't watched many of your videos yet but I am interested in your thoughts about how one gains domain knowledge as I have noticed it is not discussed often in online materials but it is often mentioned in my MS data science program If you already have a video about this I will make sure to search further When I started my program I was sure I wanted to work in marketing research I have a BBA but now I'm distracted by all of the shiny new concepts I can learn in school Now I'm considering a second master's and not sure if I should do computer science software engineering or marketing research Decisions decisions but AM probably isn't the best time to be making life decisions Hi Ken Is data engineering realted to data science Can u suggest learning path for it please Man all these just remind me myself I tackled bunch of majors even filmmaking then end up doing Economics Now in my I became data science freak It's sad how those years were unproductive but I think everybody has a unique career and that brings us unique opportunities So I'm learning R right now but sometimes I think about starting python Do you think I should stick with one at the beginning Or is it okay to learn both at the same time Given that I do not work full time current do you think it would be feasible for me to spend hours a day in hr blocks learning various Data Science building blocks projects I did spend most of my time studying sitting in lectures back in university however not having done that recently may feel a little overwhelming if I do decide to spend that much time on learning again P S I am enrolled in Springboard Data Science Career Track I came across your channel and I cannot stop watching your contents I am planning to transform my career to be a data scientist Thanks Hi Ken I am really interested in this field Specifically I would like to work for basketball teams and have the moneyball roll Do you have any suggestions on how to achieve that goal Thanks It was a brilliant idea to gather three increadible minds to talk about such an interesting topic The three chanels are changing my life for good and helping me on so many levels during the transition to the data career Thank you very much guys Greetings Ken Jee Thanks for the clear and concise explanation No doubt with the current global climate given the pandemic this area of study is going to pick up tremendously Great to have someone guide us in the right direction Hope you and family are keeping well during this difficult period Hey Ken I am just a beginner and I wasn't able to understand why should the variables follow a normal distribution in order to apply regression Loving the content so far thanks Hey Ken How do you go about classifying data as unknown aka outside the distribution that the training classes fall into My neural net softmax probs are high for data that should be unknown Hi Ken Jee I m learning python for product data analytics and was wondering if you have any tips or resources for learning the statistics side Thanks I've got a Ryzen computer with G RAM and NVIDIA Ti since I'm going to almost exclusively work with neural networks My professor has G RAM and claims that isn't enough for the real life tasks I don't really like Colab for the serious work First the session expires pretty quickly and you should fall to the shameless tricks to keep it Second transferring gigabytes of data for training via Internet may nullify all the advantages of TPUs Colab is great for the small learning or experimental projects but it can't train a BERT based network that required more than a day on my Ti When are the internship cycles Ken Jee tell me please SSD on SATA for what kind of work in data science we can use And for SSD on NVMe the same question hope you understand what do i mean Thanks a lot for your videos interesting to listening to you Thanks Ken for this You're simply amazing Hi Ken I've been following your work quite some time now The way you keep your online presence is inspirational I would love it if you have more step by step project videos on Youtube There are so many areas in which I don't even know if analytics are applied Sport analytics is interesting for me for example Also projects with more practical implications like the regular churn model or HR analytics would add value to your channel too I would enjoy watching them on my end at least Hey Ken I am currently pursuing my ms in DS but want to continue my studies further will phd be a wise option if I want to work in industry and not planning to go into academia Or will MBA be a good option since DS needs some buisness knowledge Interesting story Please upload more data science project as well like krish naik Thank you Sololearn the course can be downloaded and you can do it on your phone on the way to work Hi Ken could you please do a video about how to move out of the intermediary stage where you have good amount of knowledge of programming and statistics but you just can't seem to figure how to get to the next stage and be fully proficient in data science projects thanks Ken Thanks for another quality video This is a golden piece of advice on the million dollar question The tier starter specs are really useful starting point for building our own PC Currently most of my work are down on my MacBook and run on the cloud Will definitely re watch this video when I actually go and build my own PC Nice guidance Video Video quality is increased so greatly Sir I request you to interview Joma Tech I was inspired to be a data scientist primarily because of my dad He is a doctor and currently practices medicine but builds models for research papers in the medical field A starting point for aspiring data scientists graduating from undergraduate degrees in data science is seeking out a role as a data analyst data engineer business analyst or business intelligence analyst There are significantly more openings for these roles than strictly as a data scientist Plus build a website to showcase particular skills through a portfolio of representative projects I recently switched from a Hewlett Packard Spectre GB RAM TB M SSD Intel i to a Lenovo ThinkCentre M GB RAM GB SATA III SSD Intel i T for data science The impetus for the migration was my need for an ergonomic keyboard because modern notebook computer keyboards are terrible for extended typing sessions Eventually I will add an NFS server providing easily expandable file storage but that is likely a project for next year as part of a larger re architecture project for my home office network and computing hardware ken your videos are the best at what they do thanks a year ago i built a computer for ML and DL Thanks Ken another great video as usual Awesome video ken just a quick note there it would have been HDD and not HHD p Else it was yet again a great watch Great video Ken Solution to the error messages I made these two changes to the scraper file and now it runs all OK JOB button Replaced job button click with driver execute script arguments click job button NEXT button Replaced driver find element by xpath ' li class next a' click with next button driver find element by xpath ' li class next a' driver execute script arguments click next button Tell me more about that usb c graphics card tech for laptops Thank you so much Ken for your awesome videos Hi Ken Jee thanks for the great content I decided around March that I wanted to make a career change into data science and quickly realized it was going to take a lot longer than I originally thought Although I have a degree in aerospace engineering I have been working in sales for the past years so my technical skills weren't where they needed to be Anyways after doing some research I came to the conclusion that starting out in a data analyst role might be a more attainable path for me because of my lack of experience and that form there I could transition into data science once I have real world experience My question for you is do you believe entering the industry as a data analyst is a good way to do it Also do you have any tips for writing a good resume when you don't have experience I have been taking online courses in SQL and Python and feel pretty proficient in SQL but not so much in Python still need to work more on that Thanks again for the great content I appreciate the hard work you've put into sharing your knowledge Hey Ken I'm using Asus Vivobook What can you say about it Thanks Great work Ken I'm working on pursuing a Python basic concept by the end of this week My goal is to apply deep learning in Computational Biology and to do a big project based on that Being a bio student this is my niche I want to work on Hopefully I will learn enough to get a research internship Considering that I am now and looking to begin a masters in data science program this fall since my current masters in exercise science has not yielded any sort of suitable or gainful employment I'd be more than content to find an entry level data analyst role upon graduation from a data science program Although I have done a handful of projects and have started building a portfolio I'm hopeful that my chances of getting an internship landing an entry level data analyst role or associate data analyst role while going through this master's will be increased It's as if I feel starting this masters program will help give me that extra edge to at least obtain the most entry level position in data analysis versus just my current degree and portfolio I say this because it seems most job listings require or prefer some kind of quantitative degree and exercise science does not seem to make the cut There seems to be too much of a question as to landing an entry level data analyst job even with a much more robust portfolio which I'm sure I could have by year's end I found this video to be extremely basic and vague and the video doesn't quite match the contents you show very expensive components and then speak how it's not really necessary to have powerful PC for beginners The general recommendations are fine but there is no explanation as for when and why you would want to get anything better than Ryzen What tasks are particularly CPU focused and will benefit noticeably from e g Ryzen processor If it can save you several hours of computing a day it can be a big deal but if it says less than a hour it's mostly pointless The same goes for graphic card Nvidia RTX Titan seems extremely overpriced for what it does From what I can tell it's only slightly better than RTX Ti and cots twice as much Is there even any reason to get it Maybe some additional optimization for Data Science tasks So far it looks extremely cost ineffective even for highest end PC Might as well get something cheaper for now and then upgrade to RTX when it launches Again unless it can save several hours of computing every day I don't see how it makes any sense at all Additionally I wonder how impactful RAM memory speed is for Data Science tasks Does it make sense to overclock your RAM or is it just a waste of time and effort Finally I'm not sure if it's correct to simply ignore Motherboard and PSU You listed a PC and then you mentioned for motherboard and other components which practically increases the price by Again depending on how important storage speed is it might make sense to get a more expensive motherboard such as B or X However if it's not as important and regular NVME SSD is more than good enough then good B board is plenty powerful As for storage Samsung NVME SSDs are way overpriced so I wouldn't recommend one personally Good ADATA NVME costs just for GB and is only marginally slower My recommended budget build based in my understanding will depend on the country but in short here doesn't seem to be any significant differences from general gaming build recommendations For processor I'd get Ryzen AF if it's available for under otherwise Ryzen is the best choice For memory if speed is not super important for Data Science tasks I'd recommend Crucial Ballistix Black x GB MHz Even if it is this kit has good overclocking capabilities Wouldn't get anything below GB as Chrome is a memory hog and you likely need a lot of tabs open for data science projects For motherboard I'd recommend B Mortar Max or Tomahawk Max as those support upgradability For cheaper options B PRO VDH Max is also good For SSD ADATA SX Pro GB is the best choice depending on your preferences regarding regularly cleaning your PC I wouldn't get anything below GB myself since this will likely cause major inconveniences For PSU anything W is good enough I wouldn't get anything below Gold certification if your PC runs for hours every day If available at reasonable price Deepcool DQ M is a good choice Monitor doesn't really matter for Data Science so anything cheap and sturdy will do Graphic card is a tricky one I'd probably try to look for a good used option for a budget build but it's hard to find a reliable seller I assume Nvidia cards are easier to use for Data Science as AMD cars get less support Used GTX GB is a bare minimum I'd recommend but if you can afford a more expensive one Super looks like an optimal choice in terms of cost to performance Personally I'd get and then upgrade to RTX when available As for the case anything above should be fine Got myself new MSI MAG case it's quite runs pretty old and comes with fans already pre installed More premium options are Phantex P A and Meshify C Secondary components like motherboard PSU and case may seem unimportant but they ultimately affect performance reliability upgradability and longevity of the system as we Still would like to know how important memory speed is for Data science tasks GB MHz and GB MHz are completely different kits for some tasks Great video ken Keep them coming From last one month I am learning data science but I was little bit confused that where should I apply this knowledge but after watching your video now I can do some projects in data science Thank you This video came at the perfect time I m leaving for grad school soon doing an MS in Data Science and Analytics and my laptop is about years old and hella slow I desperately need a new one but as a student I don t have the budget for another Apple product What is the difference between Data Analytics and Data Science Thank you ken That GPU looks like a monster O Can't imagine the performance difference with that Have you considered doing a video discussing the different operating systems Lots of conflicting opinions between Windows Mac and Linux and very few resources for data science specifically Would be great to hear your opinion on this matter Can you show us how to get use GPU resources from online such as Amazon service or Google platform I tried but felt a little hard Hey Ken how're you Great video once again Apart from MacBook and Dell XPS what are the other laptop suggestions you have The video I've been waiting for I'ma save some money and go for the mid tier one as I wanna get back into gaming Great video I have question Can i practice Deep learning using Google colab kaggle notebooks Ken what about the keyboard I see you're using a Durgod Hades Do you think a mechanical keyobard is worth the investment Also do you think that a TKL keyboard work just fine for doing data science Great content as usual thank you for your insight Thanks so much more for the video Actually I have interest in Data Science and i have just gotten admission for my Msc in Data Analytics but i do not have any basic knowledge in Machine language programming and all the necessary things needed to make the course easier for me and i am really interested in this course please what do i do to meet up with the standard of the course and also to finally achieve my purpose in choosing this course Great video Always informative AMD Ryzen series is awesome I just rebuilt with that and an AMD Radeon RX XT Absolutely awesome Thanks for making this video Man I have never own a Laptop or system before it's more helpful to understand the requirements of a system Actually I'm also planning to buy a Laptop for learning DS big thumbs up to u man But the problem is there is no such laptops under the price range of with the specs u would mention in the video could u pls suggest some if u don't bother abt the mentioning Hi Ken I was wondering the level of math you need for DS I m getting mixed results in my research I was a biology major in undergrad and the highest math I ever had to take was calculus I basically just doing derivatives and this was a long time ago so I don t remember how to do it anymore I was exploring data science masters back in my school and others and they re open to non STEM majors and the most math they require was statistics Do you need to know differential equations linear algebra and more advanced calculus Or statistics and the various statistical tests covered in statistics will be fine For beginners go with what you have Of course it is nice to have high specs but to get started you dont need that much power You can do pretty much anything on kaggle googlw colab or native jupyter notebook If you get professional enough you will need what kind of computer you need For much of data cleaning and learning and linear regression average computer is just fine You dont need nvidia cuda cores for that Waste of money for beginning Nice content Ken Great video I have a gaming pc build that I use but yours if one of the first I ve seen on DS PCs Hi Ken Could you do a video or videos on machine learning on the cloud I see GCP Azure and AWS have a lot of services that help you setup your ML environment on the cloud I believe this is going to be the future where creating a ML pipeline using cloud services is going to be crucial considering that the data usually exists on the cloud and training on the cloud is cheaper that racking up physical resources Another question is that in my data the multiple linear regression performs fairly well with the training data use cross validation but really bad on test data is that caused by over fitting For Lasso and Random Forest it's fine Hi Ken thank you for the tutorial I have followed along from the beginning until here I must admit that the most fun and useful part is to watching you got stuck by something and went through debugging I have a question for dealing with missing data in this example you consider for most categorical variables as a new category by using dummies that's what it is in my understanding wouldn't it better to replace them with other forms or try to predict them using available values It'd be great if you can share some insights on that Thanks so much please keep it up Thanks Ken for this informations that slow transition into tech review for data science I see you Ken I have only been looking at DS for two years but I built my first PC at in and I did it professional for a while so I know I have built and setup at least computers I would choose a Mac with parallels without a doubt Then you can use OSX Windows and Linux I won t go into specs since I do a lot of D modelling in Inventor I know I set the limit quite high Thanks for this video How about Apple Mac Book Pro I am planing to buy is apple laptop is good for data science any suggestion please Thank you Now you are just spamming random basic videos that are literally everywhere on the YouTube Also most of your audience probably heard about RAM before Think little bit about your audience we might have seen a computer prior to clicking on your Subscribe button Thanks for watching everyone I hope this video was helpful to you If you're new to data science I recommend watching this new playlist I just put together https www youtube com playlist list PL zq klxX ATMsmyRazei ZXkP GHt vs I took all of the best videos I made for beginners and threw them in here If you just want to jump into my recommendation you can skip to Data Professor Ken My page is not appearing as expected it is showing everything jumbled up after putting up on Github and changing the source Please suggest I have a business role in Operations Planning but all my major accomplishments were related to collecting treating and analyzing data in Excel and Power BI I am currently learning Python R and statistics to do it more professionally and in the future I would like to be able to do predictions ML to bring even more value to the business I fear that strict data roles may get me too far from the business routine what could be a problem as I do enjoy living in the supply chain area I am not sure if being a Data Scientist is my ultimate goal but I also don't know which roles would be more aligned to my objectives How do you think Data Analyst Data Science roles would blend with more business roles i posted this comment below an other video in data science i saw that both you and this guy are interested in data science so i woud like to listen also your tips I have a question about data science filed do you think that a bachelor degree in statistic is more useful than a computer science degree for go into this field in my country statistic is a sub field of social scinece and there are only few course of computer science just databases fundametal programming and statiscal sw A computer scientist has more skills in programming they study for example more sw exams sw enginners operation system but less statistic probability ecc I read that company prefer more computer scientist beacause they dont nedd statistician that are expert in hard modelling math ecc but they usually suck in it field like programming ecc but they need only basic knowledge of statistic and a lot of It skills So wht do you think is a good investimetn a bachelor in statisitic or is better a computer science degree there are a lot of master degree in data science from both accademical course a lot of people with a bachelour in computer science go in to statistic and viceversa i would like to have your opinion about this tips thanks regard from italy i like to watch your videos being a lecturer and learner its really helps me to catch right path for learning all the best love from INDIA Hey Ken It was a great insight about data science Can you make a video on How to explain a data science or ML model to my manager stakeholders with example Thank you These tips are something that most don't bother about neither about learning them nor teaching them to people thank for the initiatives Thanks for the initiative I first learned python when I started programming and switched to R because that's the language my DS course was taught on However it would be hard for me to go back to python I'm just way too used to Rstudio's interface I don't know if there's an IDE that would let you have the same panel layout on python I'm trying to decide if this field is for me I use Sales Force at work and occasionally have to pull raw data from it I use rudimentary search words or phrases to try to isolate cases our front line agents log from their customer contacts Often however there are limits to the results I get and almost always the data I get is so poorly captured that it inevitably means I have to manually read hundreds of thousands of records individually to see if there are trends The categorization of the data is a separate challenge of its own We have folks who created a system that does this automatically however it's still high level information the way the issues get bucketed It's also about days behind so trying to get data real time is another limit I'm new to this so I envision being to run raw data up to hour and be able to paint the picture of what's driving call volume trends for example that we may need to act on immediately and then having technology automation do the grunt work to classify the data and give me actionable information to present to my team and leadership But as I see it there's the obstacle of getting good data from the agents as the major issue in its own Is this even possible Has anyone else run into this I was planning to take an IBM data science course on EdX It's good to know about Kaggle I'll check them out Thanks for this presentation good stuff Hey Ken I'm gearing up to apply for an online master's in DS I have a bachelor's in math and an MS in stats from a decade ago that I ended up not really using long story I've started learning python and I'm not completely sucking at it so I feel like I'm on the right track but my math skills are obviously pretty rusty Any idea what kind of math I should brush up on to prepare The program itself hasn't even started UT Austin is still putting it together and planning on accepting applications in the next few months I was hoping to just get a little ahead of the curve I am interested in field of x informatics or data driven science or computational science which has a major chunk of data science How would you recommend me to proceed This is really helpful Thank you Ken My university now offers a dual degree in computer science and data science that has all of the computer science major courses and some statistics and data science courses I'm not sure whether or not I should major in CS and continue into an MS in CS and take grad courses related to data science or if I should get the dual degree in CS and DS Is the bar for entry in the U S for data science machine learning a graduate degree or could I have job prospects with an undergrad This video makes me feel comfortable Knowing that referring to outside resources constantly is completely normal sheds my guilty feelings Thank u ken Hi ken just saw your video again Can I host this site that you showed here to be more specific can i give domain names like www xyz com Can you share any small project based on python When I also put the Job title keyword as Data Scientist and run the program the glassdoor Job search bar only shows first character as datas Can't seem to understand why this is happening I have also tried with the other keywords like Analyst even here it just shows first character as Analy Can you help why this is happening Thank you Ken This really helps Hello Ken This is my first time watching your video I'll be checking more videos of yours but if you don't mind could you answer me a question please I was going to take master's degree in data science in Illinois institute of tech IIT from this fall semester my bachelor is CS but I got rejected because I didn't take prerequisites such as calculus and linear algebra And then I had to change my major to something related so I chose IT management in the end because I was interested in management and MBA as well since before But even now I still feel like compared to data science my major doesn't seem to be that professional So I was thinking of teaching myself some mathematics and then studying data analytics with using either R or python through free online courses Do you think a self taught grad student who majored in IT management would be okay to get a job as a data engineer in years Applied to jobs and only got call backs Does this mean the DS job market is over saturated Seems like a crazy low number for a recent graduate What are the pre requisite for these projects i e python R Sql or a person who has completely no background of coding can do it Please do reply Ken great content as always Could you list all the skills that fang would expect from a person to have Hey fellas I am currently half way through my undergraduate data analytics degree program at Golden Gate University Next semester I ll be diving into my data courses with machine learning AI data regression power BI This interview was extremely encouraging I haven t had any experience with any data yet other than excel Would you have any recommendations for any beginner projects to get my feet wet Thanks for always being a great resource Sir I want to ask you how many years will data science rule in the number demand for IT profession job Ken sir I want you to add as many projects and courses in your videos as you can Hey ken what would u say about self taught data scientists Can they never become good data scientist like others Are data scientist roles in companies can only be play by degree holders What will employers think about that data scientist Ken sir i want you to mention courses as much as you can in your videos because that will be alot helpful to us and thank you for this amazing video i really learned alot from this video More than a Data Scientist Ken is a good human being I see a crazy hype for Data Science roles jobs in India is it the same abroad like in US EU Australia Zealand and Canada This video could not have been timed better I am literally meeting with my counselor next Monday to discuss switching from CS to a undergraduate DS class Thank you the more i look at you the more you look like David Schwimmer from his Friends days lmao What is the difference between taking an online MS data science program vs an on campus MS data science program Ken Jee Import data I am dual major is CS specialising in DS and commerce specialising in econometrics I am wondering if econometrics would cover enough stats for the DS field Love the video If someone chooses an undergraduate degree in data science in my opinion they should take first and second year courses in mathematics statistics and computer science as electives if their data science degree lacks courses in those subjects I am currently enrolled in an undergraduate data science degree after taking over credit hours in mathematics statistics and computer science This advice by Jaemin is spot on and your own videos are very useful Cool video but why three clocks Thanks a lot can you please share some recommended books for data science learning Hi Ken at the error is caused by using avg salary to pivot table against avg salary it can be solved by replacing the code for i in df pivots columns with for i in df pivots columns Right before the pandemic I switched over to Data Science from Agriculture I am currently studying Computational Data Science B S with a Minor in SE Then I will go for a Software Engineering M S The undergrad degree is more modeling based they teach R Fortran I am learning Python on my own this fall I will be starting a part Python certificate part intermediate part advanced I hope this is the right track I want to learn SQL additionally I am an undergraduate in Computer Science Engineering Could you have a look at these Master's Programme and suggest me which is more relevant to the current industry requirements Note I have offers for all programmes mentioned QMUL https www qmul ac uk postgraduate taught coursefinder courses big data science msc course study Modules excluded for my intake ECS P Semi Structured Data and Advanced Data Modelling ECS P Neural Networks and NLP Glasgow https www gla ac uk postgraduate taught datascience tab structure Surrey https www surrey ac uk postgraduate data science msc modules sn Huge Thank You to both of you selenium common exceptions ElementNotInteractableException Message element not interactable element has zero size Session info chrome I am getting this error every time I run this model Dope vid Thank you for making these excellent series very well structured Hi Ken Thanks for this amazing video Can I ask you where you did your resume I mean which program or web site you can recommend and why I know you mentioned MS Word but it very poor on design Thanks One thing I would add in here I've just had a look through his code and one criticism I would have would be around his use of Oversampling He does this before he splits his data into the test and train set which causes data leakage Not as much as a naive upsampling method but since nearest neighbours is being used some leakage is happening meaning it's generalisability beyond this dataset may be limited just thought that would be helpful for anyone using oversampling methods Hey Ken super insightful video I understand you should always show results in your work experiences but how would you do that for data analytics BI experiences e g designed dashboards built charts prepared reports cleaned up data ran ad hoc data analysis etc I have listed SQL BigQuery and working git python and tableau knowledge in my skills section currently facing problems in quantifying achievements thanks in advance I am currently interning as a Software Release Engineer and will be moving to a Machine Learning role in December is it okay if I do the ML from December to August and then Statistical Consulting at another place from August to December and then go back to ML I m trying learn data science months Hi Bro I am already with years of experienced in IT CRM technology I wanted to move in to Datascience I am already working in a data science company on crm Is it a good option to move into datascience after years of exp Does company expect more if i join as a experienced person Actually i am getting a good salary but still i am just working on a tool which has just limited growth how to get one row of this data for example just to access a PTS or AST or REB column Thank you for the tip I knew about titanic dataset but wasan't aware of the others in kaggle exept in courses where they used it Is it overkill to solve one of those with deep learning or do you recommend the basics of supervised ML Tired of python python but no internship yet Hi I m student of Actuarial Science in Mexico My major has a lot of subjects related to Data Science statistics maths and code but I m really interested in have more knowledge on Data Science I have seen a course in EDEX from Harvard about Data Science Apart from all the good advice you gave us will you think is a good idea to join this course Thanks I m currently doing a masters in ds with a heavy stats component I transferred from the same course at a different institution that had one stats unit Do you think this is a good move for my career Tough call but I'd say CS or SE not particularly data science it's better to choose after you know most of the stuff that a computer student would know which you will learn in BS CS or SE then go for a specialized field Hi Ken i have strong fundamentals on programming and I can easily learn math but i don t know anything related to neither business things nor economics topics is this mandatory to become a data scientist And if so do you know where can i learn it I've had several recruiters reach out from the FANG companies recently I'm stunned that they keep telling me that I need to relocate to the Bay Area even after announcing that their workers will stay at home through at the least Where is the disconnect Ken you've made a great niche that fills a big need Thanks for your support of the emerging data science community It would also be nice to here what y'all think about a Masters program in Data Science vs something more traditional like CS or Stats especially curious about degrees labelled Masters in Professional Studies like are employers put off by that vs an MS Hey Ken would you recommend DePaul's MS in DS or MS in CS I know you did CS just wondering your thoughts Really informative our students recommended it Hey Ken Jee thanks for the video it was really helpful and highly motivated Currently i am self employed and thinking about a career transitions towards data science and i am new to coding but i have a Bachelor degree in mathematics I really have a passion for it so finally i thought why not give it a go Will you please let me guide towords it step by step what certificate do i need for a good resume or is self study is sufficient Please help What resource for statistics do you recommend to get started I am currently in medical school but I want to learn data science so that I can use that knowledge in my research projects Having so much work to do from the college side it s becomes difficult to decide how much I want to learn and in what time Can you give some tips hey man i know basic intermediate programming in R Pyhton so that i can introduce algorithms from libraries like lm in R Studio Right now i think the next best step would be to improve my programming skills since i study econometrics statistics for the theoretical basis What would be the best way to do that It would also be interesting to know if you as a full Data Scientist use libraries or if you just program the algorithms for yourself Thanks in advance for an answer Love this shit Thank you for an opportunity to speak to your viewers Ken Hope this can help many students who want to pursue their careers in data science Hey Ken thanks for another informative video What do you think of the following Coursera specialization called mathematics for data science https www coursera org specializations mathematics for data science courses nobody Ken Jee video background synth slowly opens high pass filter dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun Hey Ken should I include those projects that I learnt from YouTube tutorials or online courses in my resume Like the one you made data science salary predictor which I followed from start to end and made a proper website for it and deployed it on heroku Thank you all for watching Special thanks to Jaemin Import Data for coming on and

Guests Hi Ken Thank you for this video I just used your code and built my own little model Using data and looking back at the NBA games from back in March I would've correctly picked of the NBA over unders correctly This is a small sample size but I believe the model I have is pretty accurate However I was wondering how I would make it more accurate Like what new data points I should add to predict the score I'm very excited about the return of the NBA It will be great if you use slides Thank you that's great video What about data analysis specific projects Initially I thought I want to learn data science but then I've realized I enjoy the data analysis part more Videos improving every time man Hi Ken is this normal in the USA no photo If you don't have photo here in Europa most likely you will get no interview Culture difference Really awesome ken Every video of yours is exceptionally informative however there's one question that how much of data structures and algorithms i should know as compared to a software engineer when interviewing at bigwigs I know about various things to know as a data scientist ml but how does it differentiate you from a software engineer a little more insight on what these coding requirements are is needed Thanks in advance Thank you so much for this video Hello I have a masters in molecular biology and i am interesting in getting into the field of data science not to completely switch career but to help me get more opportunities with analyzing big data in biology Do you of any resources specific to that Also what do you think of DataCamp and their career paths First time I see someone from youtube use Spyder D Ken Jee this was easily one of your very best videos man Top notch stuff Now I am confident about what to write in my resumes and how to present it thanks to you quick question did you really master all the programming languages It is a lot on your resume Solid content Thanks for the tips expecially the part were you mentioned that you have passed the fear and it is a natural process of learning because i am having that feeling now there are so many things to learn Hey got your video recommended and loved it now I will binge watch all your content it's really helpful thank you so much I am going to pursue master's in engineering science data science from suny buffalo so your videos are going to help me alot for building a good profile related to data science Really appreciate your work Great content I love the fact that you stated the books you've read and enjoyed in the resume Lighting really helps with better video quality Hi Ken what a fantastic channel and platform you have created I have been watching your videos for the last hours now and you have given me so much insights in this small time I am torn between diving into Data Science and focusing on the path as a Digital Analyst with no programming skills Haven't found a video to that Would you consider talking about that one day soon bell notification is on I would love to contribute to your excellent work with using an affiliate link Can you provide one for www audible de Keep up the good work All the best from Austria Hey Love your content but it seems a little country specific I am guessing USA I just had some doubts Is it necessary to have a degree like you have in computer science What if our college professors do not have adequate knowledge and reach regarding this field We have Calculus in our class th and th and i have no problems grasping maths concept although i am not acquainted with physics at all I was planning to learn Python Excel and Statistics Now that you have mentioned Calculus as well i would be revising that too I just wanted to know if i am taking the right steps I am so i have not joined any University yet but have been taking courses on the above mentioned topics Hello Ken I am an arising Junior at UC Davis studying Statistics with an emphasis in Data Science I was wondering if it's possible that you can look over my resume as I'm preparing for internships in Data Science and Data Analytics Keep up the insightful content on your channel and I hope you continue to succeed in your career ' Great video As a woman I experience pushback even from family members for just being interested in science let alone math data I just decided after a year that THIS is what I want to do switching from Agriculture I told a family member who does something slightly similar to Data Science and he literally asked me if I am sure it is what I want to do because it is a lot of numbers I am excited about switching majors and going for this Weapons of math destruction was simply an amazing read this year Ken I found this site the other day while looking for a resume builder and I thought it was pretty nice It's clean easy to navigate it has a lot of cool features and it's totally free Check it out https flowcv io There is another free YouTube playlist on AI created by DeepMind one of the leading AI tech firms globally People check that out it's really simple and well explained Just a piece of suggestion on selecting keywords from job description use for loop will make it better organized and easier to add new keywords and the new added columns will always have the same suffix yn to avoid unnecessary inconsistencies skills 'python' 'sql' 'excel' 'aws' 'spark' 'nlp' 'rstudio' for skill in skills df skill ' yn' df 'Job Description' apply lambda x if skill in x lower else yet another vidoe with a bang Great content Sir please review my resume if possible I am on job hunt and your review on my resume can boost and make my resume strong in the eye of recruiter Thanks Hi Ken I am now working in a service based company with work related to documentation in matlab simulink model I am learning more and more about the ML and DL day by day till now I have completed ML course of Jose Portilla's bootcamp course on Udemy also practised projects on classification and regression just don't know how to shift to DS project internally or shift to other organisation for the same can you guide something regarding this also thanks for all the content I'd like to do a bootcamp or a certificate but I can't pay those out of pocket so I'm just sticking with Masters cause job kinda got screwed cause of covid lockdown My question is that they gave the certificates and if they giving then what is the value of it All your videos are so valuable thanks Please keep it up Thanks for the insights Ken The new set looks awesome Ken what should I do after to get into sports analytics after having a Bachelor's degree in Data Science great content dude i subscribed i did just finish a masters in quant econ field so def following your kaggle github advice regarding courses perhaps if you have a video on the fastest efficient way to land a job if you already have experience in say finance econ but none in data science and you'd like to work in quant data field that would be awesome I also would love to give back within months as i'm finding your stuff useful One video on how to build a carrer in data science Those spelling errors are pretty cringe Thanks Ken Jee Thanks for the informative video ken Currently a Diploma in Data Science Student in Singapore Glad i found your channel This is amazing Ken Great one Ken Also what would you suggest to write in your resume if a student does not have a work experience Look at that set up Have you fixed the motherboard Hello Sir currently I'm studying in th grade and I wanna ask you how I can start my journey to become a Data Scientist from now onwards and which qualifications should I prefer to Thanks much love from Pakistan Awesome info techaspirants wow wow wow O Ken Jee You're genius bro Hi Ken do you have any suggestions for how a high schooler can start his her data science career Thanks july Titip sendal Thanks for watching everyone To have your resume or projects reviewed for the series please comment below and email me at kenjee ds gmail com I got locked out of my personal website so I haven't made the changes on there yet Soon to come https kennethjee com resume Hey Ken Great effort on making clear the data science fundamentals which would help them doing projects for jobs internships Hope to connect with you via LinkedIn as I sent you a connection request Would you say that someone should start as an analyst move into engineer and then scientist Are there any prerequisites for starting with these project Like in my case i know basic python and i am okay at stats but i have no knowledge about machine learning topics Great video Ken and other playlists like Data Science Fundamentals are awesome too you are best Hey ken great video as always I feel like on of the things people miss is consistency if you do just a little but every day you will get there eventually That s actually stuff I talk about on my channel I am Vloging my path from no code to data scientist in months See ya Thanks sir best youtube recommendation Thanks for the video Ken Do you apply through LinkedIn or prefer applying to the companies directly Hi Ken I'm a Human kinetics graduates which involves a lot of sports I decided to apply data science to sports but I dont know what path I need to follow in order to achieve this Kindly suggest and I'm a beginner I just started learning R I m curious do you know what your Myers Briggs personality is I d love to see how that relates to your skills Hello Ken thanks for motivating Could you please help how to put into working model for free at a non profit organization I find it hard to find a partner to work on personal project Any tips and tricks would really help me Thank you for the work Ken the idea of showing everything step by step is very helpful for beginners It's boring indeed but no one can get stuff done without the boring phase I really like the IDE you are using here with a variable window on the top right very easy to click on and check out each new variable created is this Spyder I am using Pycharm and Jupyter notebook and didn't find similar features from them do you know if there is a way in Jupyter notebook to show table contents in a separate window right now I just use df head to check thank you so much I am a computer engineering student here in ph trying to find a topic problem to solve for my thesis Any ideas you might have Can anyone pls suggest some good laptops budget of around k for learning practising Data science I need your help i don't have any laptop before so pls help me I want to learn Data science I'm waiting for ur reply Thanks in advance I'm medical personnel now pursuing my PhD I was never good on Data science its not our primary goal in medicine But now after entering Phd my supervisor recommends R so that I can be able to analyze my data it kills me Any advice Hello Ken thank you for sharing your insights I was curious if you have any videos where you go over soft skills how to tell a compelling story Thnx Ken You are my fav YouTuber as a beginner now Thank You This is my first ever comment on Youtube as well Hey What kind of data science IDE is what Is that something like Spyder or Rodeo Great Vid Back to college almost years ago I don't think I ever tookany course of discrete math As a chemical engineer maybe it was elective Do you think this Coursera's Introduction to Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science Specialization is a good fit I don't think this course covers recursion and big O but it covers graph theory Or should I take an course specific for algorithm or data structure for Python thank you for the video and all of the information i m completely new to this field and done with my second year doing a different degree and hope to specialise in data science so this was a great starting point to get a grasp on the seemingly vast information out there can t wait to check out more videos and gain more knowledge as for my goal this summer relearn python coding from my high school years Great video Thank you for the advice What about freecodecamp Sir thank you so much These resources are really helpful and Kaggle is really amazing keep helping us sir Thanks for watching everyone For more videos on projects check out these The projects that got me a job https www youtube com watch v imMPnCHvbkY The projects that can get you a job https www youtube com watch v yukdXV LR This is literally the first video I'm looking on data science and I was a little bit scared of beggining it but you gave me a lot of confidence when giving these resources and tips Thank you m hi sir In mu juypter notebooke value count is not showing signature as value count when i press tab button Ken Jee I am doing ML right now I realized I am not good at Data Structure and Algorithms I find people advising to learn them What should I do I have a problem with doing one thing at a time Please mention importance if any Thank you D Hi I would like to get the tweets with respect to a specific key word for a specified time period can i do mba and then learn data science Thanks I need to learn the data science and currently i'm pursuing b tec and i'm good at python also very passionate about to learn data science Please explain any of the machine learning project Hai ken thank you for sharing with us the way we should take to learn becoming a data scientist Honestly many people still have lack of listening in english including me Would u like to add caption in this video Thank you hi thanx for all the videos they r really a great content am asking if u can have a video about remote working and internship because am from morocco and i love data science and am starting learning it but companies in this field here is so rare so am asking if there's a chance to get a remote internship in american companies after i finish my studies and projects I saw ads I clicked Tks for your very useful sharing videos Send my best wishes to you non technical or non coding guy here looking for career in IT pls suggest the non technical roles in IT data science blockchain etc pls help Thanks Brilliant work as always Is it true that there are no datascience jobs and internships for freshers that are recently graduated from college or do they need some work experience in order to get a job Does being a SWE in a big tech company adds as a advantage to get a job or do we have to have datascience domain experience only to get a job in FANG companies Do reply Thanks ken great video I am on the project level I am doing Twitter sentiment analysis and learning NLP I have a question i refer to other people's github for guidance Like the github i am refering for twitter sentiment analysis uses NLTK but in my project i am using spaCy Can i show this project in my resume Thanks for this Ken Im learnning Data Science by my own and im trying to find the best type of learning that is best for me your video helps me a lot ill try to do more projects and see more the documentation You are the hottest data scientist Thank you so much for this series it's really helpful for beginners like me I have a question though I followed almost exactly how you revised the codes the only difference is probably that I am using data from both Canada and USA and the salary estimate column shows all identical values e g CA K CA K Glassdoor Est but all the other columns e g rating company name are just fine This is so confusing to me since the codes formats for reading estimate salary and rating are the same Any insights you can share why this occurs Thank you so much Really like the advice you give us here especially the kaggle part I have been using those trick of reading someone kernel notebook but it does get overwhelming so knowing that it's hard for everyone really put me at ease By the way would you mind if I email you just to get a piece of advice from you regarding my study path This is the best DS channel on YT Hello Ken very refreshing videos I have obtained Master degree in Telecommunications and am working as a network engineer I have realized that I miss programming so much since I was very good at it and math in high school I had some programming on college C MATLAB some very basic Python but since then stopped programming because my job doesn't require it I like data science artificial intelligence and Python so I enrolled in PhD program in IoT where I've got some subjects such are Neural networks and Artificial intelligence in telecommunications Please do you have any advice on how to manage my time since I am doing a job with shifts have to study and make projects for PhD and need to learn Python statistics and similar topics in order to make career change and become data scientist I would much appreciate if you give me concrete examples materials what to study and pace for passing them Cheers Amazing Just one thing I want to improve how can I set the text align to the left instead of the center What a Irony sir I always gets the solution of my problems every time from your videos at perfect time Your video on LSTMs inspired me Built the same thing with a CNN Looking forward to learning more on Kaggle now Hey man really enjoyed your video Would like to ask a few things I've started a data science course on udemy and I would like to know if there's any platform that you know of that would help me practise the concepts I've learned Let's say I just finished regression and I want to practice some problems on regression where should I go Also would it be possible for you to make a Kaggle tutorial that would help us familiarise ourselves with the website Like I tried to get on Kaggle and found myself lost and everything looked very high profile and I didn't know where to start as a beginner What do you mean by documentation You were abit vague there Could you elebarote on that THANKS Hi Ken Please do live project or end to end project like you did with data scientist salary prediction Hi Ken I have a doubt regarding the projects It's like what stream should I pick up should I experiment it first what suits me where I should be moving or else is there any particular domain to start with for career options The videos you prepare are so on point and informative It is not vague The correct amount of informative touch with a pinch of reality Hope it gets more amd more better from here The only video that didnot satisfy me was with jay it may be the rich content he has in his youtube channel already you just stopped the questions with few anyway enjoying the growth thanks Love the B Roll scenes Huge fan of doing projects to learn Applying the concepts I learned into projects has helped things stick better for me I found your channel just after I started learning Data Science about a couple of months ago and you've been really helpful and encouraging man Keep growing the channel Ken k is just around the corner And I wholeheartedly agree with your tip of reviewing other people's code My number one tip is to go through GitHub and search by keyword for projects that interest you From there you can find people's scripts and run them chunk by chunk This way you're learning from people that have a good coding foundation This is one of the methods I used to learn R that was awesome thank for the content Hi Ken I m a year old in highschool and I just finished a course on Data a science on Udemy I have attempted a few projects on Kaggle and they ve worked out pretty well Do you have any advice on how I can progress further and some goals I can work towards Thanks for another great video Ken The video editing and transitions are awesome I certainly agree that one of the misconception of learning data science is limiting one's learning to a particular resource as you said nothing is stopping us from learning from another resource Because the thing is different resources may bring slightly different angle or coverage of the same topics and thus helps us to gain a more thorough breadth and depth of those topics Really like the rinse and repeat part learning data science is indeed a never ending iteration loop Informative tips Cannot stress the importance of learning how to read documents Another super helpful video Thanks Ken Do you mind sharing a link to your Kaggle profile I'd love to explore some more of your work Thanks a lot Ken Awesome content as always That was awesome sir i really loved that and pretty much motivated by that One unique thing i noticed today was your camera quality that was awesome Hi I am from India Here the IIT India's one of the best technical institution is going to provide a bachelor degree course of data science It's a year online course with exams to be attended being present physically in their campuses So should I just concentrate on that course or complete it side by side along with Computer Engineering just loved the image audio quality on this one congrats Ken Is that the p inch monitor have the pixels been enough for you Awsome video ken sir Sir where to practice SQL and is there a need to learn PLsql Thanks for watching everyone The resources I mentioned in the video Free kaggle micro courses https www kaggle com learn overview Data Science Discount on one month https datascience pxf io Z gXQ off one year https datascience pxf io JG yR Affiliate Links Can u pls tell me where can i get cetificated also in free of cost for data sc course Hey thank you for making these videos I am reading moneyball and have been doing a lot of research into sports analytics I came Across your page and found soo much good information and am glad you re creating this content to help people get started Hey Ken thanks for your videos I am currently finishing up my Bachelors in CS and plan to get my MS in Data Analytics I ve been learning Python on my own time and I ve build several text based games My question is what should I learn after having a good grasp on Python to help me expand my knowledge in the Data Science field What tools or frameworks should I use when building my Data Science portfolio projects Awesome content Greate Help thank you so much ken i just begin my journey learning data science with no background and your videos rock Hi Ken Jee and Data Professor thanks so much for this video It's so helpful I was able to add featured images to sections of my portfolio but when I tried using figure src images resume jpg title resume to add pictures of certifications and my resume the images are not showing up They only worked initially when I was hosting locally but now it doesn't work both locally and after hosting on github I am temporarily using dropbox links to show them but I'd appreciate if you could give suggestions on how to make it work Thank you again I have some grasp on Deep Learning and Python programming But when it comes to applying my knowledge on the datasets I suck Any tips my dear fellow learners Hi Ken can you plzz type the company s name in the reply It s the company based in Chicago that works for sports team Thanks The best way to make money with data science is to find an area of activity or industry or obscure market that can benefit from optimization with ML models Man always love these talks wish you had a discord channel or slack channel Great video as always Hi I am facing error when in hit the url after adding the files to github thank you for the info you provide I really want to thank you as I already have done first projects during this lockdown I realized that everything is possible to learn You are very good person for sharing the invaluable knowledge Hi Ken Can you just explain that part of converting hourly wage to annual Btw awesome content Hey Ken thank you for this very helpful video I'm using your code and I tried to scrap tweets for a specific user but I can't use it for a specific user What could the problem be there HELP Very nice video I'm studying data science and business analytics right now I hope to finish my bachelor next year and your videos are always very helpful and insightful Avengers Assemble Love these type of videos You Guys are awesome Always happy to watch you guys wish you all the best Which language is best for data science R or PYTHON Thank you the tutorials are very crisp and interesting Favorite series for sure Hello Ken Jee I really like your videos I have one weird request I always wonder what topic tips formulas notes should we have on walls so that I could go through it every day And I have seen in some of the videos that you are having some lists Notes on your walls If you don't mind can you please make a video or share details on it please Thank you Thank you Ken for such a wonderful tutorial it was easy to follow and simple for a beginner to keep up with I have been scraping Data Science jobs in Canada and they are less than My num jobs variable is So what is happening is when the scraper reached the last page on glassdoor it is going in a loop and collecting data from the same jobs over and over I guess it will do that till the length of jobs dictionary reached What can I do to make it stop once there are no new jobs Do you even get a certificate from Google Machine Learning Seeing what people have done on Kaggle can help but better than Kaggle projects is to make your own projects which will require that you obtain data on your own or from someone else It's more effective for the learning process when you have a connection to the stakeholders Outstanding video love the way you break it down to the bare essentials as to how we should approach the development of this new set of skills ohhh Thank you for your tips Ken Made all the appropriate changes and it definitely feels more like a complete project The podcast was great Ken i have a doubt that in order to get hired as a machine learning engineer or a datascientist in FANG companies is the knowledge of datastructures and algorithms necessary or not Pls do reply Can you tell me why in RandomSearch for ml model uniform and reciprocal is used what is its significance purpose I have no idea about this and google seems to be not helping me Thoroughly enjoying your videos man I've taken a dive into data science the last months with a similarly circuitous path eventual Econ major actuary tech at big currently applying for MS in DS Sensing that I've stumbled upon a treasure trove of know how here It is always a pleasure having conversation with you all I learn something new every time we talk These type of videos are very inspiring Thank you Replay gang From Time management is one of the most important skills One of the things I did in college to stay focused productive was to have a solid wall between the studying productive time and my leisure time For instance I would be productive from am pm and reward myself by doing something fun playing games playing with my dog etc for about an hour Then I would get back to the productive time from pm pm and reward myself again Thank youu Keenly waiting I would really appreciate if you guys would come up with a video on how to start as a datascientist from scratch like a complete beginner to getting a job in FAANG Discussing everything like how to start of with projects best resources how to learn ML and AI and then how to get a job and ace coding interviews stuff like that Trust me if you do this your podcast or respective channels will explode Pls do consider to make a podcast on it Hey thank you very much for this video it has been really helpful I watched and learned some basic statistics and linear algebra from miycourseware lectures and i did this to build a base to like start data science I want to go into the use of data for business intelligence and I'm thinking of joining a graduate school for data science next fall do you have any recommendation for that Like what should i do for business specific data science Again thanks a lot for your videos Do we need a cs degree to get into fang companies Have you heard of sports management worldwide subs since you posted that's amazing can't wait to see your channel grow more Let's do this boyzz Thank you for such a direct no frills video Would you say that learning SQL is still a big part of data science Sorry if this was already asked but skimming comments well done btw isn't easy I've never commented on a YouTube video before but I just wanted to let future viewers know how great this video is Great work Ken Camps out in front of my screen in living room for premiere Just started preparing for data analysis portfolio last week started working on kaggle projects learning more in depth concepts Definitely inspired by the channel plz keep the great work going Cool video mate How to know about some beginner projects on kaggle i mean working on titanic model is cool i guess hey this content is very useful

you'll see a request from me any day now Thanks Ken for another great review of data science projects Analyzing these personal spotify data is useful and matters the most to oneself Great initiative This seems so cool Would you share the github link too I would love to use this to build my own playlist xD Hey Ken What are your thoughts on relying on R more than Python for data science Hello Ken thanks for your suggestion your one suggestion which pricked up my ears was make a list of packages having vague knowledge and definitely go through the documentation PS C Users pc desktop examplesite hugo server Error Unable to locate config file or config directory Perhaps you need to create a new site Run hugo help new for details i am facing this error plz solve Sir your glasses looks good Can you please guide on some of the good IT Courses Certifications where coding skills are not required Thank you sir I have been searching for such free online course Subscribed to your channel Jedi Mind Trick hands Hey Ken it's me again Do you think creating a website by means of shiny package of R predicting the nation based on the given answers would be a good project for a freshman economics student being willing to be a data scientist I mean would it be worth spending my time Here's the draft of it https mevluthancerkiran shinyapps io firstproject I had no data so I used a pseudo data I am planning to rise the number of questions and the quality of them In addition I will try to collect my data myself Thank you in advance Due to covid the aus government is sponsoring retraining and data analytics stood out for me I come from an arts business major and I'm an English Second Language Teacher All the work has dried up and I was transitioning to work in film but with restrictions that won't be possible anymore So I've decided to retrain I dont know if data science analytics is right for me because I havent tried it however I did do well in stats at uni and maths in school I figure ill give it a go and if i dont like it then what the hell i only spent for months of which i wouldn't have worked anyway Thoughts Just researching this has kept me up at night hey ken this was so helpful hope you start a series on them P S there's lot of github repositories to widen the knowlege bank of data Hi Ken thank you for your contribution in data science field I have a very general question I have recently chosen the carrier shift into data science and learned excel tableau sql and currently learning python so how should i cope up with the practice to make sure that I donot forget the usage of previous tools Is there any way that i stay in touch with all the tools that i learned everyday very excited always very informative from Sir ken Jee Thanks It is mentioned briefly in this blog You can go through this link to get a brief understanding about the courses How does a total beginner start to learn machine learning mlarticle learn about ai and its subsets https mlarticle com how does a total beginner start to learn machine learning it should help you good luck Ken would really appreciate if you put some videos of different alogirthms such as logistic reg decision tree random forest etc Ken Looking for someone who has worked on Cricket analysis Could you recommend Would really appreciate your help Hi Ken The books which you told to refer are for that particular sports or in general Sir I sent you mail with attachment of my resume and GitHub link I request you to kindly review my resume and GitHub profile Thank you so much for this video your channel has by far the most helpful content on data science on YouTube and its not even close Keep up the great work Ur content is one of the best Can u make a video on which is a better career option a data scientist or a software developer can you please show your room it seems very interesting Do you think the course offered in Kagge too simple It just gives us an overview about topic in each course Thanks for this video It was really helpful This is really informative Hey is it necessary for data scientists to know html and css This was ver useful for someone new to the field Thanks man Thanks help full video Hello Ken can you please tell me how important it is to learn ML to learn Data Science And would you suggest some sources kaggle is phenomenal I can't believe how intuitive and generous this is Hi Ken Firstly thx for video I am a psychology student from turkey and I intersted this field DS We study on SPSS program and study some statistics topics on our department Can you what recommend for me to me for go my DS way My backrond is enough for this field if your answer no what I have to do I wanna growe up myself for Ds by self learning Now I am study Python and then I will learning R ML and AI Thank you for your advices In Kaggle I hope the projects are solved I mean the codes are readily available to check so going through the code snippets and understanding it makes the right strategy Ken or should we choose a fresh project What if I want to stick with business intelligence analyst only Thanks Ken for these amazing videos Could you please tell us datasets for these projects from Kaggle Hello Great video We do appreciate for this information A quick question what is your insight for Berkeley Extension Data Analytics booth camps Hi Ken It would be very helpful to review data science course contents of colleges and institutions Your video seems so insightful and makes me feel so much better I am just starting new PhD program in brain fmri analysis and am reading many articles in relation to machine learning algorithms Do you think it would be worthy spending much time on the mathematical derivative of algorithms or rather like you said trying to know the use and some constraints of those I am puzzled about this question since the derivations are too complex to understand sometimes Congrats on K subs much earlier than expected Thank you so much for this information I am currently working towards completing my AS degree in computer science Before I enter the Data Science BS program I plan on taking a course I found on Udemy on Data Science I feel like this will help get a basic understanding of the field before jumping into the degree program Hi Ken Would it be possible to embed a neural nets chatbot into Hugo Thanks Ken thank you so much for your videos Right now I'm studying a DS and your explanations and advices are invaluable it helps me to understand my teachers and improve my skills Hey Ken does it matter whether my project goes into the model production aspects Would it seem too lackluster to just cover exploratory data analysis aspects Also does the model production aspect require machine learning or is it even just things like prediction in regression Thanks again Excelent video Hi Mr Ken Been a self taught programmer and a background in agriculture I'm looking at the requirements for being a Data Scientist ML engineer and it's almost overwhelming How important is learning the maths behind machine learning algorithms and what would you recommend for me given my background Ken s energy is OFF THE CHARTS You can tell he s living his best life Hey Ken Thank you really for everything you share with us I've started my journey in data science a couple months ago I completed a bachelor's degree in statistics and I would like to convert into Data scientist I have some questions for you and I thank you in advance for your answers with my statistician background do you think I can be good enough to have a job in datascience I have completed datascience bootcamp and I want to know ways to apply all the knowledge I got there how can I find a distance job in any company or enterprise because in my home country it is quiet difficult since we don't have enterprises really needing it Thanks a lot and I don't know if I can get your mail for further discussions Thanks This discussion is definitely going to be valuable to people who are looking into FANG companies Thanks Ken for another quality video Great insights on the FANG interview process Jay Thank you There aren't that many data science youtubers so this is really helpful Hi i started learning python during the lockdown but I really don't know how to figure out what i want to do with my life going forward after university Any advice please Great video Thank you so much sir for posting this interview i really wanted this Amazing work brother A similar video on the skillsets required to get a job as a machine learning engineer in FANG companies would be great Continue the good work brother This was super fun Thanks again for the interview Ken Is taking up online certificate courses in Data science or AI better option and what about the job prospects with an online diploma in data science Replay gang Awesome Omg he speaks so dam bored Very good one wow as a newbie watching you do some cool stuff is so interesting D Especially the last part with that WorldCloud I think it's an amazing package Hey I want to get more into Business Intelligence but don't know how to get there Any tips I'm a Statistics major and a software release engineer intern graduating in This was so helpful My background is in biology and cognitive science psychology and throughout undergrad I've been using Python and R to run a variety of different analyses for hypotheses research questions and data insights Most of these don't have a ML component I'm learning that now could these projects still be relevant for landing a data science internship Thanks for the advice subscribed right away D Can you help explain how do you choose the right method SVM Random Forest etc to be implemented in a model for any dataset Does it depend on the complexity of the data FyI I think the idea of kaggle itself has grown pointless when teams with big compute capacity and pretty much educational institutions have thrown the completion out of skew I found the wind your voice content a great combination actually lol thanks for the info Ken thanks so much for these videos I was able to land an internship for an online retailer and look forward to getting some great experience I am hoping to turn it into a longer internship with them mo yr as I graduate with a master's in DS in august of next year Do you think this is a good plan for transitioning to one semi related field into data science Again thanks so much for the videos Another awesome video Thanks Ken By the way I'm really curious on how if during master Phd degree we also have a job as DS in company Please make this video to negotiate yourself company and college it will helpful for me and other hey ken i hope you are fine stay home stay safe i would like to give suggestions to make videos on data visualiztion real time projects of data science contest going on kaggle and teach how to solve them just do not stop making these wonderful videos on data science it is very helpful for newbie in data science All the best Thank you sir it's very helpful and motivate me Hlw Sir Will we get certificate after completion of the course Plz tell Ken you are the G O A T I recently started to learn python and its application in data analysis but I was struggling with getting the data in the first place This series is awesome keep up your good work Hi Ken I have a question for you do you or your colleagues often work overtime Are you getting paid for that time I m from Russia and working extra time without getting paid here is a norm Curious to know what

and Data Professor I've just published my first github data science portfolio website https hoooni github io VincentPort I start this lesson from subscribing this channel Hey Ken Please tell what's your nickname name at Kaggle Want to follow you dear Ken I could not open the medium article It seems that I should have the membership Is there any other way to share that article Follow right after this video dear Ken May ask you to send me the link for basic statistic course the link you shared is not the correct one I also love the background music Can you tell me where can I find it Thanks for sharing this I've been kinda back and forth on my data science journey since I started a month ago I started a trial with one learning site but had to quit because I don't have the funds now Hopefully I'll find a community here Thank you veryy much for such an amazing project You have covered end to end of this project and it is very very helpful for beginners like me Thank you so much Hi I've heard also some negative information about this book Why we sleep I haven't read it yet by myself but I want to do it soon but in the other yt video I've heard that author's research are quite questionable like lower cancer rate when you sleep less than h something like this I think this makes sense because just like diet everybody's need of sleep is different and it should be more personalized aswell Nobody should force himself to sleep more if his body doesn't need it Your channel is great anyway keep up with the solid work how to get a freelancing remote job in the current pandemic situation are you able to make money via playing numbers can you review resumes and portfolio's privately I mean reviewing them but without putting them on youtube I really appreciate your efforts you are a great person I want ask you some questions please can i work as a data analyst or data scientist from my home in Egypt at company in America or any country college degree is an important to work as a data analyst or can i do the job with only my skills is it too hard to be a data analyst or getting a job how long it will take in average should i be professional to get a job Thank you in advance Hi Ken Thanks for video I agree with you about free work Any ideas how to find such companies Why this is so fun to watch D This guy is like the Jet Lee of Data Science Thank you for your playlist It's really helpful Hi Ken Does learning Computational Geometry help you in the field of Data Science shout out to intermittent fasting and morning coffee Thank you so much I cannot believe I didn't realize how helpful Kaggle is Quick question Would feature normalization and normalization of skewed data improve the results in this example or is it unnecessary Any quick comment would help thanks Learning a lot about the best way to structure my resume from this series Looking forward to impress recruiters at my college starting this fall thanks to this channel Hey Ken video was truly helpful I am a graduate in management studies finance still i am not good with maths and i'm very much looking forward to learn about data science how should I start kind of confused Thank you so much hello ken do you know any free resources for learning statistics for beginner i have zero knowledge in this Great Portfolio thank you ken for advice i am personally working in computer vision domain as an intern at present please explore computer vision as well in coming videos that would be great help as CV would be the future really good stuff Ken I've been looking for tutorial like this one thank you I am an entry level software engineer in the pension domain But I want to work in the data science field for music technology specifically Music Information Retrieval I have an average programming experience through MATLAB and C I will be following some of your tips to get started on my data science journey but this was definitely motivational and directional Hi Ken everything went very well till clicking on my website link created by GitHub But as soon as I opened that link wishing to see my website it shows There isn't a GitHub pages site here Could you please help me I don't want to waste my hardwork Special thanks to Keshav for letting me use his project as an example If you would like to have your project reviewed please comment below and send me an email at kenjee ds gmail com Yeah this series is super useful for beginners like me Thanks for making this I really like this series and I really learned a lot I am also reaching out to you for a project Idea I am a data engineer Please help me I just spent the last several months learning data science and I thought I was ready to start applying for jobs I did so this morning and to my great disappointment I found that every entry level position required years of experience and already had applicants This gives me very unpleasant flashbacks to trying to apply for entry level electrical engineering jobs after I graduated I do not believe there is any quantity of hobby projects I could do that would allow me to enter this market I'm sorry but your entire channel is a waste of time I find your youtube channel to be best available for data science in the internet Thanks helps me a lot Awesome suggestion ken I have known Keshav for quite sometime and iam sure he will go places Another awesome video on resume review Impressive profile keshav and great suggestions Thank you so much Ken Solution to one of the problem that I ran to Error ElementNotInteractableException element not interactable element has zero size Session info chrome Just replace the line job button click You might Line number around with driver execute script arguments click job button I just scraped my job posts without this nagging error Cheers Wait so if you want to get into data analysis of sports or anywhere you have to do computer science Or you just need to know how to use Python R to code for all the data entries Awesome portfolio Thanks for doing this Is this from the perspective of the US market I want to start in kaggle projects please recommended for me some project i can solve thanks Can these projects be done in R Or is python recommended A good series explaining the data science process which a lot of videos and articles ignore This video in particular would be the time to mention using existing and or creating a codebook for the dataset Hi Ken Your videos are very inspiring for a college student like me wanting to work in the data science field I have two questions about the portfolio What is your expectation of an about to graduate college student to be like Is it a good idea to include a blog blog posts about your projects' journey etc portion in the portfolio You can easily select and copy code on GitHub by clicking 'Raw' when you view the file then press CTRL A and CTRL C to select and copy it before pressing CTRL V to paste it into your editor Great video Ken I also did two MS degrees one in CS and am currently working as a data scientist One piece of advice I have for people who are considering graduate school but are worried about the cost is to look for schools that offer TA RA opportunities Depending on the school these positions can fully cover tuition and pay an additional stipend for living expenses Finished the ML mini course in kaggle now home prices project and just about to watch this video Build a project for next Ryder Cup winner I'm fact don't need to as it'll be Europe enjoyed the video From Northern Ireland Hi I am a grade student who wanted to get in the field of data science is there any chance that I can learn data science in year I only understand python and if so can u guide student like us Thanks a lot for this Ken loving the raw approach Also you could've just downloaded the Jupiter notebook as a py file Looking forward to this Cheers I want to build a chatbot for depression how to gather data What kind of data do I need Hi Ken i am beginner here how to display the methods and properties list of pd like you did at in the video Ken could you please suggest me few good laptops for data science Thanks in advance I want to learn Computer Vision in months to be able to get going with a research with my university professor Great content in your videos I m trying to get into Data science and I started learning python Let s see how it goes I appreciate your work on providing the info on Data Science Sir when we build models or something else does it need to have a front end a well Or just the model is fine for now I'm in the last year of my college My mini projects and things I would like to learn in months Python programming with raspberry pi set up good sensors to collect data Machine learning neuron network focus on image processing object detection Some database management with MySQL and python I still want to enhance my data visualization skill Maybe I will try Kaggle soon I have already started some very simple data sets from Kaggle just to practice to use matplotlib I am good at Math but I have not tried any algorithm class what would you recommend if I stay with Python Also what are some good kaggle datasets you would recommend to practice with machine learning or data visualization skills Can you tell me some source for R Super helpful video links Thank you so much for sharing I finished The One Thing last week and was super happy with it Definitely my preferred type of book I just wanted to know where you found these books Were they recommendations from colleagues or possibly a list of books found on a website Also if you had any recommendations on books to learn more about statistics I would love to hear about them I took statistics in undergrad which was a few years ago and am in the middle of a career change and would like to brush up on the theories and the essentials for data analytics data science Hey I just completed kaggle micro courses till deep learning I want to work on a project with someone more advanced than me Can anyone include me in his her team congratulation It s great seeing this channel grow so fast Congratulations Ken Hi thank you for your videos and you are doing an amazing job i am working towards becoming a data analyst not a data scientist i would like to know if i should follow the same course as someone who is willing to become a data scientists or should i study different courses i tried ibm professional data scientist and it was almost a waste of time Nice detailing Ken I am and a retired teacher looking to start a career in Data Science I really appreciate this work from you This is the best advice I have received Thank You Congrats on k subs It s great to see your channel continue to grow and how much progress you have made in the past few months Keep up the good work Congrats Ken Thanks for value information if we replace base estimator Decisiontree with Kernalized SVM in randomforest how will affect decision boundary and how it will relatively affect time and space complexity ken Jee can you link the dataset here At when you wrote this code X sm X sm add constant X model sm OLS y X sm model fit summary After Writing this code i am getting this error ValueError Pandas data cast to numpy dtype of object Check input data with np asarray data I have searched on StackOverflow applied different solutions but none of them worked Hey Ken love your video and would like to know the background music congrats buddy You speak to slowly What an incredible video This is well timed for me personally I m so excited that I just found you to learn from What a brilliant idea for a YouTube channel Hello bro I finished this series and went through all comments also for different approaches My question to you is to refer some books for learning maths and stats Algorithms I am a new joiner in data science and was browsing about it and stuff Saw your video click on it subscribed and shared with friends Good luck with your channel I'm trying to learn data science by myself and Ive been told I'm a quick learner but then I know that I lose interest or motivation even more quickly and have been at this for quite some time without much progress I think I should go with the projects and learn alongside hope it works Mind blowing the way to learn data science that u have given Thanks a lot more video that ll be helpful for us Geez i have missed the the live I hope sir that you will be hitting k milestone till the end of the year and recieve silver play button Thanks for the wonderful information you shared with us I have a question I have a Phd in petroleum geology now learning data science on my own do you think projects from kaggle would be good on my resume Any suggestions on how to find some valuable projects on my resume Thanks I love the natural and realistic rhythm and pace of your videos and explanations no flashy cinematics nor unnecessary distractions Been watching your videos for a while now with another gmail account and they re one of my favorites Keep up the good work Saludos desde Buenos Aires I have completed my high school in india I have decided to pursue a course in data science What should i learn first I Just know it has statics and programs I don't have any basic idea Is there any free apps to learn about data science what must be the basic qualifications to get a secure job in data science courses Do you know the general acceptance rate for Masters in DS or Stats I'm guessing V log lmaooo Congrats Ken I am happy to be a part of the community I am here from the times where the channel wasn't so popular like it is Today P I am looking forward for the movies about Kaggle This is exactly what I was looking for not only a list of all the branches of math needed but a list of elements inside the branches that are most important to learning data science As a future economics major I love that your career path started with Econ I hope to do the same I love computer science but always debated it because I love finance and economics even more good to see there s opportunity for Econ majors to really get into data science Thanks a million Congratulations ma guy Well deserved I missed the live stream but I was wanted to ask as far as data analytics goes what mathematics is needed For context I have a degrees in mathematics and phsyics Sorry sir i was not able to watch this live beacuse i was out for playing cricket but I'm watching this now and next time i will watch your live during live streaming Very excited for you on reaching the milestone of K half a year earlier than planned Great value you are bringing to the community Next step K and perhaps K by the end of the year Great job remember our bet Congrats on K Ken Your growth is insane but you definitely deserve it Keep up the good work and hit K before this year ends P This is fastest growing channel on youtube dedicated to DS Great job I started reading about stat yrs back also learnt indepth theory for linear logistic regression etc did very basic kaggle project I work in bank months back i got my first real life banking modelling project Dara quality is horribly bad I have seen rather than the process its good engineered feature that improves the model But what demotivates me after much thought also my features don't improve model Also i am not good at finding good insights They are average Any tips There is so much content and so many books on Data Science What to start with Im literally a beginner Cool Is it possible for finance graduate to make career in dat science Hi Everyone I am really excited for this It is my first live stream so please be patient with me as I figure out how to use the technology A few people have reached out about the data science discount here is the link for off https datascience pxf io NjbEv Ken been watching your videos for a few weeks Really enjoyed the content you put out here As someone who has gone through the whole switching from non tech major to data scientist data analyst where is the best platform to learn all the basic beside Kaggle Would Dataquest Datacamp be a good source You mentioned project based learning is the best way to learn data science besides looking at the project you mentioned above anywhere else I can start getting my hands dirty Congratulations on the k ken Also I need a little bit of advice here I'm trying to make a simple portfolio for myself and was wondering if you could suggest me a simple portfolio template just like your own website this video is not useful very confusing Hey Ken I am a really big fan of all of your content and you have truly inspired me to enter the field of data science and sports analytics I am an incoming college freshman math major and I have been learning SQL and python through code academy Other than projects do you have any tips to make myself stand out in order to get an internship I hope to intern with the Los Angeles Lakers analytics team and I could really use some advice Your videos and website playing numbers are the most helpful resources related to the field that I have been able to find keep up the great work Dear Sir I have done my bachelor degree in Arts background English Literature but school and higher secondary was in Science field I want to build up my future studies and career in Data Science I have asked a lot of people around me but didn t get any appropriate answer whether I am eligible for learning Data Science from scratch or not My aim is to do MS in DS and try to get funding for post doctoral program too I m also not sure whether US universities will allow me for this since I have no bachelor degree in Science or Engineering It would be really a pioneering suggestions for me if you give me your valuable advice regarding this Thanks for reading my comment Hoping to hear from you soon Ken we would love to see more series like this Totally loveddd it Excellent ideas Thanks for sharing Thanks for sharing what are some techniques to collect data other than web scraping questionnaire and using API's Hey Ken jee I hope you'll be able to help me with my thought does venturing into data science naturally means degrading your eyesight since you'll be staring at the screen What can be done about it And especially of the programming and casual gaming aspect because I hardly come across topics about eyesight when it comes to these Asian parents equate computer screen bad XD Thanks for taking time off in advance I'm Mechanical Graduate with years of experience as Design Engineer in Automotive sector I'm good with python and Tableau At present I've one question how to get transition from Design Engineering

or something The information is too valuable and well explained Thank you How about those courses on coursera thank you Ken Hi Ken Thanks for making the video I found it very useful as I immediately started to build my own while watching your video I have a request for the upcoming videos or if you have made one let me know as well I would like to know what should we post in a project repository While portfolio is more like about the summary of all projects I want to know what good repository can describe the project clearly and meaningful Thanks Ken and as always all the best for your Youtube channel Never knew there was a vendetta against pie charts in the Data Science community but now I do Learning more and more from this series Ken hi future me let me see where you at now wish you can find this comment when you back here As with the previous videos enjoyed the transparency and the analogy itself Thanks I am a certified public accountant and looking to get into an analyst type role Do you think I would be able to do this with the background that I have thanks so much day am soo glad i found this when i was beginning my data science journey i am a physics major trying to venture into data science Thanks Ken Jee Love this series Ken It s been very helpful in getting my head around how to organise my projects thank you Awesome review Ken Nice example of a student profile Fist of all thank you for your time making this series It casted a lot of light to me on the big scheme of things in a project how you handle it as a whole Most resources deal just with certain parts so they miss the big picture I'm having a hard time I'm trying to get ready a data set cleaning inputing binning etc i wrote individual functions that take the full dataframe as input and outputs it with the respective transformation inputation Resources mention that is good practice to write functions So i did Then i stumble across custom transformers now I'm trying to create one to use it rather than the individual functions What is the difference between using lambda funcitons like in here and creating the custom transfomers Is it good to write one transformer that will deal with all the steps cleaning custom value inputing changing types of values discretizing aggregating categories etc etc to get my dataset ready Or what am i supposed to do Then i would like to use it in a pipeline to finish with encoding and scaling I'm kinda lost and can't find any good resource to solve this Thank so much you and keep the good work This is so good thank you so much I'm binge watching your channel as I am becoming a better Data Scientist thank you for your material Is this microsoft sql server the same as mysql Congratulations Not too long ago when I subscribed to your channel after watching the NBA simulation video I think you had something like a few thousand subscribers Now you're at a testament to the quality of content you're putting out Keep em coming Nice video I'm not familiar with your channel but saw the thumbnail its length and clicked through a few other ideas resources to choose from that I think can be really helpful for beginners depending on how they like to learn Make a habit of partitioning off a small portion of your learning time to do some light reading on best practices this is softer information and can often be more subjective than the harder skills but it can be extremely helpful in adding context to why certain things are the way they are and potentially help save you some cleanup down the road things like docstrings virtual environments project directory structure etc Like everything else this can be overwhelming and my advice would also be to choose one thing at a time and start trying to build it into your workflow docstrings and virtual environments are both good examples of things that take a little getting used to but can feel very fluid after a short period of time and save a lot of headaches with package managers if you're using vscode or PyCharm the autodocstrings are great and keep your time spent doing the things the machine can't not playing with margins Listening to podcasts about the subject IMO is also extremely valuable and can be done on the go even if as a beginner you don't understand much that they're talking about hearing others talk about common problems before you get to them can help you understand what's happening more quickly whenever you do Additionally a huge part of this field is learning how to articulate the problem you're trying to solve for on google stack and listening to podcasts can help you learn how to articulate things better both verbally and in writing I'm much less familiar with the R podcast landscape but for Python beginners Talk Python To Me is great for slightly deeper dives into a specific problem domain and Python Bytes is good fun weekly exposure to the evolving packaging landscape Quick addition to the above point another thing it can really help with is understanding the extent to which most problems particularly on the data processing cleansing wrangling front have already been solved for I've often seen more novice programmers try to recreate the wheel at every turn and hearing more experienced people unpack how they approach problem solving can help save you from writing a script to do something that's part of a standard library Time spent finding the right resources is never time wasted in addition to paid courses etc I'd encourage finding someone on Youtube similar who does a good job of articulating things in a way that makes sense to you Corey Schafer has a fantastic Python channel covering everything from basics best practices to end to end application development Acknowledging that this would fall somewhere towards the latter half of the progression outlined in your video I think it's super worth calling out that all the services we use personally have open APIs from which we can programmatically extract our data from and can be a great way to build out your mechanics in a fun more personal way it's also a natural and safer step towards web scraping since it's all the same communication protocol Amongst many others Spotify has a super user friendly API and a well supported helper library called Spotipy for anyone who might like this idea and be looking for a place to start Python beginnings to start learning how APIs work Again great video and I hope the data dump's welcomed Great Content as usual Ken Jee Always good to see other people's portfolio best channel on youtube keep it up Awesome It is a great series I really loved it sir Thanks for the great info I am a Data Science and Statistics major and CS minor at NKU I can graduate a year early if I switch to Stats major and minor is CS and Data Science Should I do this and then pursue a masters in Data Science I just finished my first year and I currently have a software release engineering internship and also have a ML internship from December Thanks for another great video Ken Like the new lighting setup Can anyone suggest free best course on statistics for data science I see you too have Homo Deus there another reason why I'm learning Data Science or technology in general hehe Thanks a lot for reviewing this I'll definitely improve in the areas you mentioned and much more Hi Woohoo Special thanks to Anurag for letting me review his github and resume If you would like to have your work reviewed please comment blow and email me at kenjee ds gmail com Thanks for this video and I must confess I can relate to your story as an upcoming data scientist Thanks for this video awesome video Hi Ken Jee it's my first time here in this channel Thanks for sharing your data science journey and giving good advice I graduated from Bachelor in Chemistry worked in Biology research field mainly bench work for years and intending to pursue a Masters in Biomedical Data Science I would like to ask if learning Python and basic statistics through online courses will be sufficient for me to bridge that gap between wet lab based research knowledge skills and data sciences bioinformatics I'm unsure if this is the right place to ask about biomedical data science bioinformatics but I am hoping to receive some advice from a data science expert so that I can better prepare for a field switch Thank you awesome I am an experienced java developer with Python handson Thanks for this Little steps are key One thing that I ve found to be super helpful in learning data science concepts is to read google scholar articles on the topic at hand I did this for the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm and I was surprised how I could start to understand the math after continued exposure I still don t have neural networks or naive Bayes methods down but I hope I can do the same there Hi there I just found this channel in this week and I wanted to say thank you for introducing me to google colab I was looking for a way to practice without downloading packages to my computer Thank you so much The data science sample code is located here https github com PlayingNumbers data science starter Hey Ken I recently graduated from university with a major in psychology and a double minor in computer science and mathematics I struggled a lot with the learning environment of university and unfortunately wasn't able to pursue a masters degree Instead I've taken a real interest in data science more specifically machine learning and have starting taking some courses online I plan on doing a data science bootcamp later which looks promising from the research I've done My plan is extremely raw but I hope to combine machine learning and psychology for the benefit of therapy and other aspects of the human mind I just wanted your advice and general thoughts on my situation Thanks so much Love the channel by the way so happy I found you I must add that your teaching Algorithm is accurate I would have written but that will make your model your teaching over fit you know what I mean Thank you for sharing this is totally resonates to me thank you I really enjoyed your series thank you It was very fulfilling to see all the theory I've been learning in my Masters in such an easily understandable and interesting approach New subscriber I found your videos last night and so glad Very informative Summer goals Your channel is gold brother keep it up Yet another gem of a video Ken Thanks Thank you so much Ken It is very helpful sir i learned algorithms in python is it enough for freshers to get a job apart i learned tableau and DBMS IN SQL This was incredibly interesting thanks for sharing your thoughts on this Ken May I know which package did you use for the PCA I am in love with you HI Ken I am getting X out failed while scrapping people when to pass axis parameter in DataFrame apply function Ken doesnt put it in a few functions and it works but at the program hits an error Very informative I have read many blogs about free courses but everything listed here was new to me One of the best advices I have received Good job and all the best Science is SCIENCE Hi Ken I want to thank you for your content I find it really helpful Also I had a few questions that I wanted to ask you what would be a good place to shoot questions Thanks Congrats on hitting k sub goal Youre awesome Really enjoy learning from your channel I really like the way you open up this learning techniques I'm new in this field and please would you be my mentor What about SQL I feel like my code is much more legitimized now that I've watched this lol thanks for the great content as always Cheers for this I have been researching content management job description for a while now and I think this has helped Have you ever come across Tanathan Hyperstorm Social do a search on google Ive heard some decent things about it and my partner got great success with it Ken Jee sir i am excited for your Q A What about coming live for it on YouTube What are python topics to learn for data science Ken Jee Sir Your video is really useful I know the concept of data science but don't know how to practice programming please suggest something to how should I practice the python to get better in programming use it for DS and ML Awesome video Which resources did you use for the maths A great instructor who is putting out sincere content Ken sir you're absolutely correct But remember when you got out of this hurdle and pass rubix or complete learning data science or anything you will get a great reward for it Your are seriously underrated Is there any ideal order we should start learning these math concepts Thanks Thanks A Lot Ken For Your Data Science Project From Scratch Playlist Series Ken Can You Recommend Some Youtube Tutorials OR Blog post where i can learn About All Machine Learning Algorithms The maths behind them and also to implement them using scikit learn And i am interested in starting freelancing in Data Science ML Can you give some tips on how to start freelancing on upwork fiverr about Data Science ML Thanks In Advance Hey Ken I had just finish all the modules in data science except for the new BA module I am revisiting ML and DL Tensorflow as i guess these are the basics which i have to be solid in to progress The risk credit is the most difficult and i had yet to fully understand it Time series and customer analytics are much easier to understand The final five modules are basically implementation and are mainly ML How should i advance like learning more advanced ML and DL Should i just go kaggle instead or borrow books to enhance my skills as i do not know how vast the world of ML and DL is LOL Thanks Thanks Ken I have already started to break bigger problem to smaller manageable ones I hope will learn the skills soon such an honest answer ken good lesson It's easy to get overwhelmed with the choices we have and stall your progress as a result One tutorial one project at a time Keep up the good work I work in refugee protection and I am trying to gain skills in this field to apply it to predicting refugee status determination or other general human geography issues such as modeling human movements internally within countries based on unrest or disaster IDPs or cross border movement The UNHCR has datasets available publicly in the form of csv files How can I start to work with these in a Jupyter notebook Does this need to be done from the terminal on Mac or can I do it inside Kaggle I'm very new to all of this and just want to play around with this data relevant to my field this video is a good guide for a beginner like me start somewhere and usually doesn't matter where sounds like gradient descending my ML knowledge loss hopefully I can also persevere I have been taking the Kaggle micro courses but recently I m thinking about quitting because the machine learning part is getting frustratingly hard I have so many questions because the reading doesn t explain every line of code thoroughly Mindlessly copypasting code from tutorial to exercise problems really makes me question the rationale of learning data science I have no one to ask for help so I think it s extra hard because I have to google everything which is super time consuming and I don t often find the answers I need Thank you for the quality content Recommended your channel to my friends as well great vid man i also come from business background and now struggling to learn DS and ML especially the math part keep up the good job I liked what you said about focusing on the individual steps without looking up too often I look up to check my progress too frequently and end up feeling overwhelmed about how much is still left to learn Thanks Ken hey ken jee when are algorithms and data structures required in data science life cycle and when should you learn it when starting your learning process Thanks for the video Great insights as usual very informative Also congrats to Pranav on his very unique portfolio website I sent you an email about a possible collaboration for your ProjectReview series Look forward to chatting with you more Ken thank you so much for this video All of the advice given are so valuable and I really needed to hear them Thank you for all your amazing content You're the man not only highlighting great courses to use and the general way to go about growing in the field but also the words of encouragement for a newbie like me have been extremely helpful Thank you This was a really great analogy towards the process of learning data science This reminds me of my data structures class from freshman year where my professor said that even though that most people will have the same type of code to solve a problem there are many different ways to approach it Pretty much just like how there are many different ways to learn something I'm still on this journey as well and just like the advice given here I use resources that make the most sense to me when I'm developing projects I relate to the small wins thing as well whether it would be making tutorials for Data Science concepts for the organization that I'm a part of the Bit Project or making projects through the knowledge that I have gained through tutorials Of course my code wouldn't be as complex as someone else's work the important thing is that I made something that I'm proud of and that the ability to continuously learn will get you far on this journey Thank you for the wonderful content as always and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day Hola hola Thank you so much for your content I feel more confidence drive and motivation when I follow your advice A video of yours where you mentioned accountability popped up in my YouTube feed after I missed a week or of online data science class This video gave me at least enough confidence to continue Thanks alot from the Philippines Thanks a lot for sharing I am a graphic designer strong with design visual skills frm media background years What job profile would be best for me then here to learn Also Many industries have age criteria after certain age then dont hire u How does age factors work here when a old age fresher works under age experienced person Hi Thank you for this video Myself I m a undergrad majoring in business information systems I ve been trying watching videos on data science and etc I m still trying to navigate what I want to do in the future with my major Also I ve been getting my certifications and areas in data science and cyber security too Will it be safe for beginners like me Amazing video I also believe in divide and conquer approach which always works I already had a solid Math background when I started learning DS but my graduation was years ago I also had a LOT of programming experience but not in Python or R And still my greatest problem wasn't the Math or the Python it was lack of the systematic approach When you go for one of the countless become a data scientist in hours course you don't really understand that material The worst thing is you might THINK you understand it but that's a false feeling There is no way to understand it all in hours be prepared for a long journey or retreat There are three books that I recommend to everyone Mathematics for Data Scientists M P Deisenroth and others all math you will need in a convenient form Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analysis Johh D Kelleher and others everything about Machine Learning except for the neural networks Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit Learn Keras and Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron a great book about Deep Learning you may skip the other parts All three books have a lot of exercises and you should do ALL of them After that you will know enough to consider your knowledge solid I've stopped on the exercises for the very first chapter for now though I've read the books of course Thanks a lot Ken Can you please suggest some books to read for Data Science Thanks I want to swith my career in to AI machine learning field I did IBM Data science certification Can you you please tell which online course should I take next to have practical knowledge I have learnt basics of python Amazing as always Ken you entered the field when data science was something only a handful of people could do now you need much greater expertise to enter the field esp with the economy the way it is Great video I also like your podcast with krish sir really amazing work all of you r doing Wow Ken it is amazing to see how much your channel has grown when you had a few hundred subscribers and now k Keep up the good work Hi Ken as always it's a pleasure to watch your video that distinguishes you from the many yackers around talking about data science When i was listening to you it came into my mind Tim Ferris and i thought about selection one of the key steps to learning In my idea to learn data science the first step involves figuring out what are the most frequently used and important mathematical models and algorithms Once we have this shortlist we can select key programming languages i personally opt for Python and R and try to work out real world problems with these languages How do we do to know if we are gonna do well One way is to pick algorithms as performed in any of the courses you proposed or even in Kaggle where i have been starting giving a look implementing to the real world problems as said above and double checking the solution by implementing the same algorithms using secondary high level programming environments like Matlab or Mathematica I know that mathematica has lot of functions that help you do what in python requires dozens of lines Just sharing with you this crazy ideas Ciao Thank You Ken Your videos are really helping me to change my perception towards this new challenge More power to you man hands down probably the best portfolio video ever Hello sir you're a sports analyst know i have one idea regarding duck worth Lewis method how i can contact you for sharing the idea plz reply sir Hi Ken this video appeared right exactly when I just gave up doing my Coursera course in math for data science as I couldn't solve function approximation task Seems like I am too dumb and don't have enough math background to be data scientist Science I only can code but when it comes to advanced math related problems I feel depressed Did you have the same feelings or it just me These advanced math related problems really scare me didn't expect to face such problems where I don't even understand the task itself Hey been watch your channel for a while great stuff Could we get an in depth video on the differences between a Data Scientist and Data Engineer It would be really helpful Ken I too was all over the place and felt like I wasn't going anywhere So a few months ago I refocused and decided to learn SQL NoSQL first Just weeks away from completing certificates just to give my learning journey some context I estimate I'll be at an advanced intermediate level My next puzzle will be math and statistics Wish me luck going forward Another great video I think the advice you give is very useful because I've been following the same methodology when learning Data Science for the past year I'm try to understand and practice each individual part of the whole process of building a project first and then in the end everything manages to piece together perfectly after that I've been solving Rubik's cubes as a hobby since so I think I'm pretty good at not giving up when something gets difficult Just as you said it takes a lot of time and patience but with enough motivation and hard work you eventually reach your goal Here's my plan I'm good with computers Python is sorted Applied Data Science with Python on Coursera got for free using university email Think Stats Business Essentials on Coursera again free Kaggle Will you please comment the great apps that can be freely study data science certificate course Following him since k subs What r u doing guys Just press the like button He's fucking amazing Hey Ken This is fantastic Narrating your experiences in such a simple and easy way makes it quite encouraging for beginners Thank you Thank you very much Iconic Ending Jee simple but powerful This channel is growing so fast love it Thank you for all the amazing videos Hey Your videos are always amazing Can you make a video on the learning path for AI I am a first year undergraduate in Computer Engineering and want to study AI but I don't know the right sequence of approaching things It would be very helpful of you if you could do it Regards Hey man knowing that it's not that uncommon to struggle in these topics is quite relieving thanks for sharing So good Thank you very much for making me realize I'm not the only one facing these hurdles This is a good analogy Ken Luckily I took relevant courses step by step over the years so I only had to focus on certain things when learning DS I can only imagine how daunting it would be to jump over a huge hurdle or to climb up a huge mountain as you mentioned in front of people who are just starting to learn I believe this video can guide people who are just about to learn data science in the right direction It's important to take small steps at a time instead of trying to do everything at once Hi Ken Thank you for your video To be honest I have literally watched almost all your videos and get excited when ever you post a video Can you make another series on Data science projects like you did previously Thank you did not see that Rubix cube coming k in the next months Bet it Congratulations on k subscription Eagerly waiting for next videos as well Thumbs up to the rubiks cube analogy Great video Though is it possible for me coming from finance background to have a work in Data Science Always giving the useful advice Wow I needed this after being overwhelmed yesterday Thanks man Thanks Ken for another awesome video Just a moment ago I was about to find something to watch on YouTube and discovered your video in the recommended videos Great analogy of mastering the rubiks cube and learning data science particularly like the advice on breaking the learning to chunks and mastering each chunk Thanks for doing a Webinar with Krish Naik Hey lets be youtube buddies dVSG Ken Jee I am always waiting for your content I hope to create something as useful Thanks for watching Free Kaggle Micro Courses https www kaggle com learn overview Discount on Data Science Affiliate Link https datascience pxf io Z gXQ Dude looks like a better looking Elon Musk hey i just started learning data science about month ago I followed your steps to learn I've learned python basics by doing courses on udemy for python also for matplotlib numpy and pandas I also learned abit of nlp because I will be doing it for my FYP However now after going on Kaggle and following your advice to read and understand the expert notebooks on Kaggle I just feel so overwelmed by how much I do not know I find myself googling almost every line Is this feeling normal Should I just keep going learning this way Komentarz dla statystyk D Hi Ken Jee thank you so much for your videos it helps me a lot to navigate what I need to do to improve my portfolio Would you mind giving me a little bit more information about this I generally put my analysis writing on my Medium com and code on Github Then I connected the two together because I got those Medium com articles that got featured on TowardsDataScience Plus Medium com generally provides a much better layout for my project analysis Do you think that approach is much better compared to just publish the analysis on Github Looking to hearing from you soon I have a UG in Business management I currently work for telecom infrastructure firm as a service Desk analyst I plan on getting a masters MBA in Business analytics and would like to combine that with Data science by getting certifications from online courses and building projects Is it any good I'll need your advice sir Ken One more for your list I discovered recently is MIT OCW open courseware also completely free you can donate if you so choose I found the their probabilistic systems course to be very helpful for understanding the basics of probability modeling the course material is all on the website but you can also just watch the video lectures on youtube https ocw mit edu courses electrical engineering and computer science probabilistic systems analysis and applied probability fall Love this series hahahahahahhahahahhahahahahhahah Hi Ken thank you for your great content so I am new to data science here data exploration and data cleaning are where I've stuck for a while now Is there any book or resources explain things step by step One more thing is I've understood your code but I don't get the meaning behind especially the scaling data Hi Ken as to the website is that ok to just use website builder like wix or world press Does the ability of building a websites using program language also matter in building data science profile Hey can you upload some videos on how to start and be much familiar with kaggle would really appreciate that Thanks I'll be graduating with a degree in electrical and electronics engineering and I'm looking to do a masters in Data science and business analytics Would this be a good combo Hey Ken will you make a video on github its usage application storing files and stuffs 'extract transform blowjobs' Was following steps and at Filtering are we able to filter string column e g Country Name out of Country column And how do I input ' I ' 'or' symbol KenJee Sir this is very helpful please keep posting such discussions God bless you and your family the twitterscraper tool isnt working now any other easy alternatives you suggest other than the official apis If anyone getting error at when Ken tries to convert it into int I tried this method and it worked for me df 'min salary' pd to numeric df 'min salary' errors 'coerce' df 'max salary' pd to numeric df 'max salary' errors 'coerce' df 'min salary' df 'min salary' fillna astype 'int ' df 'max salary' df 'max salary' fillna astype 'int ' After This Data Type Will be Changed From Object to int You can also check Data Types of every single Column in your DataSet using df info Or df dtypes In Jupyter NoteBook Would you recommend using Andrew Ng's machine learning course on Coursera for someone looking to get started with machine learning and data science New here Hi Ken thanks for the info How do organizations value certifications from udemy coursera and datacamp It seems that they are much less rigorous in assessments than other formal studies through universities Besides if there are so many people pursuing the same route do you think employers would give preference to those who studied data science in top unis Do u know how I can be a ball girl or towel girl Hi Ken would you say that a data science certificate from a top school is more valuable than some other normal online data science certificates in terms of resume boosting I am currently considering the data science online certificate from UC Berkeley which requires taking courses one core one programming one machine learning and two electives on SQL How would rate a certificate like this My major in college is Economics and I want to follow a path in DS what do you think Thanks for sharing mate this was a great vid Hi Ken I am about to finish my PhD in applied physics I would like to move to the financial market after graduating All of my papers are focused on time series analysis from the brain with graph theory removal of artifacts and so on Would you have some specific advice Naturally my portfolio is basically scientific papers which is too academic Thank you so much Hi Ken I tried to use 'Business Analyst' instead of 'Data Scientist' When I reached i got this error ElementNotInteractableException element not interactable element has zero size Session info chrome Do you have any idea how to solve this Thanks in advance selenium module error on python please help Good starting point Let me share my experience I have a master in statistics I can code in R and I have good experience to conceptualize data products However I'm still far from a data scientist There's more about data engineering getting the data ready and deployment platforms UIs APIs servers containerized DevOps that need to be included in my skillset Your journey shows almost half the way towards data science This is for everyone keep learning new tricks and practicing with real examples Hi Keen am planning to update my laptop that is future proof for data science job e g running power bi tableau Alteryx etc etc what you recon the minimal requirement for that Disk space ram and processor etc etc Hello sir How one can avail internship for Data science Can you guide for that Thank you Ken love from india I had started learning the basics of data science a month ago but had a break due to various works from college I hope i don't break this habit again Thank you very informative great stuff Thanks good video I'm a physicist in the last year of my career I'm learning python R and SQL more python for do data science and I'm learning statistical inference and non parametric statst I think this are the basics Then I want to learn Spark and Hadoop but what do you recommend me to learn before I am thinking about docker Can i start doing the project without completing any of the micro courses on kaggle or should i start wth the micro courses first before start doing the beginner's project Great advice ken Ill be going for bachelor of data science in the following month and this have been very useful as i wanna prepare before jumping into bachelors Thanks for the video Hi Do I need to start studying data science if I am not a technician engineer I don't know python and I have got only basic knowledges in math Hi Ken I'm a little late here but I'm getting stuck trying to run the initial

but would love to follow along Can you suggest some free and good resources for learning ML using R Clever bio on his Github nice example to refer back to as I'm learning more each day Thank you Sir I am an engineering drop out I want to focus on data science Some People tells that you must need graduation to become a data scientist So what can I do complete my graduation which takes years or focus on a data science stuff Please suggest me I am very confused Very good tutorial I love the way you explain things It's easy to understand Hi Everyone It appears that this api is not working right now

prepare for a masters in data science after my third year of university Thank you If we follow all these videos step by step could this count as a project to put on a resume or LinkedIn Hey man thanks for your videos It could be better to just download the notebook and convert it to py https stackoverflow com questions how do i convert a ipython notebook into a python file via commandline Hey Ken Love your videos just starting to binge I am starting my MS in compsci with specialization in ML Do you think that this is better or on par with the MS in data analytics from the same university Thanks Thanks for these videos again Ken I just finished making my website this weekend One quick question If I already have my website linked at the top of my resume should the links to my projects go straight to its respective repository on Github or to its page on my website Which would be best through the perspective of the hiring manager Thank u so much for your videos I'm actually taking the business intelligence business course from data science at udemy My goal is to finish it to the end of september appreciated for your excellent and exceptional work As a suggestion the videos are a bit long it would be much better if you split them into like scraping data data cleaning etc Hard to see some of the codes on big screen maybe consider using Jupyter Notebook or changing the font or background colour Thank you for your all hard work Hi Ken I really loved your coolness while solving data science problems This skill is the most important provided that we have to deal with tons of dirty work Also I think for 'Rstudio' in Job Description numbers are so less because you are separating r and studio Please try RStdio It might give correct estimation of real value counts Thanks Do you consider Computer vision as a part of Data science Subscribe ky baly subscribe wada hy Experiential learning is the best way to learn and go through Data Science very truly said because that helps us to evaluate where we lack and hence one is able to extend their domain of knowledge Time to put the pedal to the metal Thank you for your suggestions I've done the Titanic project guided by the step by step instructions I am not familiar with the Python libraries I'm not clear on what it all meant Now I am working through the ML mini course I might go back to the Python course to refresh my memory about the basics Then I'll try the Home Prices regression Question When you say 'google' the algorithm do you mean to search for a conceptual understanding of what the algorithms do Thank you Mr Ken jee Hey there I am leaning towards learning Data Science and aiming to do a Master's in the fall next year I have started gathering information of what I need to study to get a decent clarity on how to start For accountability purpose I have started with python language Will be watching more of your videos Thanks for the information why physics as second choice abvoe math and statistics what does physics have to do with ds more than a minute long intro when the title already tells us the topic about the video Free Kaggle Micro Courses https www kaggle com learn overview Discount on Data Science Affiliate Link https datascience pxf io Z gXQ This series is really helping me a lot Thank you for making such amazing videos Ken Loving the series Ken Pranav has impressive portfolio indeed great job Thank you so much for taking out time to review my portfolio ken Keep growing you Juggernaut Creator on rise Hola hola hola hola hola hola Ken you're awesome keep up the good work and keep helping everyone Specially students like me Great video for newbie like myself Finally able to relate the self help python course with the actual production on a dataset Trying to brush up more exploration although had some difficulty when hit the 'Graph' section Unable to form histogram as it depends on the data type seems like data type object is not possible or maybe need to import 'matplotlib' or 'seaborn' knowing the difference after Googling it Should we have the Knowledge of Natural Language Processing to follow this project Please make a follow up video on this after discussing with Pranav on how he made the website good luck Pranav love from Singapore unemployed undergrad Awesome stuff Love this series Great job Ken Jee I come from an industrial engineering background can you please suggest what should I include in my portfolio Thanks nice content bro qmND Good job Ken Loving these episodes ken Keep posting Awesome Ken Special thanks again to Pranav His portfolio website can be found here http pranavarora info If you would like your projects resume or portfolios reviewed please comment below and send over your info to kenjee ds gmail com Hi Ken I trust you are well Thank you for your videos I started watching your videos when I found an interest in data science I hope there is a way I could perhaps chat with you as I have just a few questions I hoped you could answer I'm moving to Munich with a maths degree statistics and programming knowledge Its nice to see this video to remind me that i don't have to be an expert to get an internship Thanks Ken your videos as very informational and motivating If it's not working on your pc try on another laptop or your friend's laptop with editing query py My friend is a savior Hi Ken I am senior level employee working in finance but I started gain interest in developing my data skills however being my age committingg to a master degree will be something I have to think twice however I have been learning on my own I found some good and useful course online and it is really cheap option for me to get started but I want to get deeper and broader about it getting a job being a data scientist is not my goal here my goal is to being an BI Consultant like I am pretty good with Power BI and Tableau but also possible other tools what you say mate should one get a masters in DS even though you are more interested in Data Analytics and are already an expert with SQL and Power BI I feel like MSC in DS gives you a better chance to land a Data Analyst role than those without it Great work specially it look you have great command in pandas That's fast learning Thank you I want to ask How to enter data sets that are in the computer folder Just cause you asked There is a suggestion Why did you not select raw format and copy from there Maybe it was an update but the function desc didn't work here I had to type description Ken do you recommend data science courses from udacity Hi Ken I have a bachelors in chemical engineering and some years of work experience I m interested in making the switch to data science Do you think a masters might be worth it for someone in my position Most masters I m considering are k k total MIRA MY HOUSE So much insights you are a gem You makes DS interesting I am coming from computer science background I took lots of stats courses but doesn't seem to sink in into me I keep using just basic stats for my work in the finance decision support department in hospital I am starting to learn Python Based on your experience what kind of statistics I should focus on study on that I can use at work I plan to apply machine learning to emergency department that is a project I plan to take on Hey I need to learn statistics from scratch for data science I am a total beginner What free and best online materials are there Please give a link to them Great vid just wanted to know your opinion of doing a master's in behavioural economics and data science https youtu be qZINLzwYyk t What did Krish Naik mention after H O ai Well I find this motivating Even if I lack the confidence to collab I can learn that on my way It still shows tweets even when I edit in the query py man iam sry but this information is useless i learned tableau basics dont know python can i get a job though my futuristic plan is complete data science Great Video Ken loved the content Thank you so much Wow This man is the chad of the data science community Ok I really wish was explained more what are you doing here excatly This seems to be right where I start getting confused Hello I am trying to find out some Data Science Certificate programs no idea how to get around to find them most of the links from google search just doesnt seem that impressive I have a Masters in Engineering working into my Doctorate now I want to do some work with programming and machine learning later on so want to prepare for that beforehand Any recommendations on how to look for some good Certificate programs Hi I have few questions Is it better to start my masters degree right after undergraduate Any advices for an international student who wants to do masters in USA Would it be possible to find job opportunities I think learning by doing is a wonderful fun and efficient way to learn a range of skills HOWEVER after years developing for large medium and small commercial non profit military defense and other companies across communications strategic data media AI quantum AI full stack and other areas I have also seen the dangers of that as a primary let alone singular learning approach People who learn exclusive via doing especially working predominately on their own while eschewing theory and complementary skills prior to that approach often have major applied theory and application context gaps in their knowledge that they appear generally unaware of Obviously this depends whether you are learning predominately on your own or if you have guide s mentor s and or teacher s that help point out short comings and gaps in your knowledge base and approaches There are multiple factors underlying this problem First it is very hard for most people to deeply self introspect to see where they lie on broad based external knowledge continuums without significant sources of historical theoretical and contextual reference This is why the first factor of where people are on the Dunning Kruger curve skews left with people who have largely self educated without a broader base of external references as noted above The second factor is the fact that most of the time most people simply do not know what they don t know In other words it takes a broad base of external theoretical historical and contextual learning to develop metacognitive skills to help us intuit where we have gaps in our knowledge base and to consistently discern correct from incorrect conclusions While working on our own is a great way to learn deep practical skills we see that it often comes along with blinders to broader alternative views and approaches In other words you can easily be unwittingly blind to the fact that your toolbox is mostly bare and that you don t know how to optimally use even the tools you do have For example we see people who have never heard of Donald E Knuth JADD or Charles Petzold that have instead learned simply by doing who code using approaches that others have long since bypassed resulting in programming that causes problems and often must be rewritten and projects that must be taken over by other groups ideally prior to them causing real world problems in the end user community So while there is no substitute for hands on learning and many have succeeded in becoming gainfully employed as programmers without much classical computer programming training or academic education even hands on learning approaches work better in the form of a balanced apprenticeship approach where you work autonomously but under the direction and oversight of someone much more knowledgeable and skilled than yourself The fact is that the number of software developers on the planet doubles every years As such by definition this means that half of software developers have less than years experience The number goes down as you get to more specialized areas of knowledge that increasingly can have a broad based impact in unforeseen ways on the future of humanity For example the number of AI programmers is doubling every months and is still falling This means that on average AI programmers have a year or less programming skills in AI Increasingly the percentage that have any significant general programming or computer science education is dropping as the demand for AI programmers is far outstripping what our universities and training centers can provide As such more people are self educating often by jumping in and doing prior to getting any significant training Sadly many of us who don t get the academic knowledge and theory up front never go back later to address that since they get too busy and immerse in immediate needs So the gaps and deficiencies upon entering the workforce often are carried throughout their carrier Often they become highly proficient programmers and such in whatever language s they happen to need for the tasks at hand but they often don t learn to intuit when for example they should turn to something like Node js versus Python or use Matlab vs Tensorflow etc So what is the negative result of people learning predominately hands on rather than under the oversight of others who are significantly more knowledgeable and skilled and preferably with a good foundation of theory and broad based learning to bolster their metacognitive theory and analytical skills development The result is that suboptimal approaches zero hour bugs and higher rates of failed projects as defined by the failure to meet one or more primary deliverables as defined by the final SOW Further as AI is integrating to the very fabric of our digital world we are seeing a wide range of badly trained and architected systems that are leading to avoidable deaths flash crashes in major global markets just in time delivery system failures and much more We know the causes of these are often programmers who are being primarily trained autonomous hands on approaches So given that traditional education in the form of BS MS and PhD s in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people from a financial standpoint what are the alternatives First online learning when done in conjunction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful high utility educational base Further programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in Also as AI is integrating to the very fabric of our digital world we are seeing a wide range of badly trained and architected systems that are leading to avoidable deaths flash crashes in major global markets just in time delivery system failures and much more We know the causes of these are often programmers who are being primarily trained autonomous hands on approaches So given that traditional education in the form of BS MS and PhD s in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people what are the alternatives First online learning when done in conjuction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful way to learn Further programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in For example say you spent a few hundred hours learning and taking on a few projects in Python and Swift You should also read several of the seminal computer programming theory and related books at the very least in the areas you are focusing on and preferably add to them over time once you have internalized their benefit Statistics repeatedly show that people who never learned core theory prior to beginning a career have a much lower chance of ever learning those areas Similarly it can be a great boon to identify a local universities or a company that needs interns where you can work under and along side others with different skills While the pay may be minimal or non existent EVERYONE self taught university skilled and all other modalities of learning should intern just as is done in other mission critical and related fields like medicine And it is a LOT cheaper than the college alternative In medicine it is done on top of years of additional post university graduation education while in computer programming a rapidly increasing percentage never even get any post graduation training of any significant merit let alone intern apprenticeship training Is professional programming any less deep or broad of an area of knowledge Not if you want to excel in terms of being at least well rounded and far more employable than average and definitely not if you wish to excel in skills compensation and job satisfaction So don t migrate primarily to hands on without getting a good base of other approaches behind you because statistically you probably will never go back to rectify the competency knowledge and related gaps you create by doing so I work as a finance report analyst with some sql queries with visuals in Power BI but its more of a accounting role and I am trying just to focus on data analysis I have a Masters in public administration and did publish work and did go thru statistics class I am not sure if I should do the Boot Camp or get a second Masters Degree Boot Camp at my University is about thousand dollars even though I have the money dont want to spend it something useless that will not provide the tools I need to get into the filed I have seen countless videos and it seems like some ppl say that its a scam but I really want to get an insight would you hire me as analyst if I have a boot camp and some prior experience Please make more of these Hi Ken Can you make a vlog about your hardware setup Great content btw Keep it up Hi Ken Jee I just completed an undergraduate degree in computer science and engineering and also I landed a job as a Quant Developer in a reputed financial firm I am planning to do Masters in Data Science in next two years Can you tell me that this kind of job experience is beneficial for me or should I plan to switch my job Thank you so much for the very useful tutorials hi i have one question I am from non technical background and want be business analyst so how a company is going to look at my profile after getting necessary certification please reply Thanks Ken Jee You have been inspiring many data science enthusiasts like me I learnt so much about Data Science and it is just because of these youtube channels You all are excellent mentor for those who want to start their journey in the field of data science Thank you so much for delivering such wonderful contents Im ramnivas

defined Already subscribed all of you guys I can see your channel is growing rapidly right now Keep posting great content man Really appreciate your efforts Great I am learning Data Science on my own I dont have data science course in bachelors However I am wiling to do it myself Keep motivating Thanks to all the panelist for sharing this valuable roadmap of DS We all came to know how to head start and where to go now Special gratitude to Ken for arranging this Hi daddy He is so hot and that's why he's on daily creater no one's talking about the nut button on his desk behind his monitor hy ken thanks for the clip have been trying to learn data science but still not working i will be grateful if you could be my data science tutor plssss nasver gmail com Huh I am so lost YouTube Nominated You For Creator on the rise Congratulations Ken so much clarified in such a short video Thank you A Legend was Born Carmen V zquez L pez When I see your subscribers base growing ken it feels like a personal growth too Thanks for such an insightful panel discussion Hi Don t forget the ice cream Lol there is no sales major I did some network analysis of Game of Thrones characters using Python to find out who is the most important character https www linkedin com pulse who most important character game thrones i used find lukashevich I'm very happy to watch Ken's content before starting my senior year of college Not aiming for a DS title right away looking for for BI Analytics This is cool because you three were already are my go to for data science tutorials advice and such Its like you already knew who I was subscribed to I wonder if you can see who the common data science channels your viewers subscribe to for more interesting panel talks like these It is also reassuring and exciting to see the upskilling journey I have ahead of me Thanks Ken Beware of Student loans says a man who should've known better majors First of all thank you very much for the amazing videos to help and motivate us beginners Now I have questions that might sound stupid lol I am currently starting with the housing project and I didn't know how to start on my own so Im using other notebooks as references and kind of copy pasting would you consider that normal when starting or is it bad I'm gonna reference links to both of them when I finish my work of course For the getting started projects in Kaggle in general and the ones you mentioned in this video when do you think I can say I succeeded with this project like what's the minimus end goal in the score or something like that Again thanks Awesome Thanks for creating this guys I didn't know about Krish and the Data Professor It's great to show such a diversity of backgrounds I am a beginner I have just finished a degree in Mathematics with a focus in analysis and statistics I'm using HackerRank to develop my python skills I use kaggle for datasets I perform statistical learning techniques using R and I am using Elements of Statistical Learning to learn the mathematics this is important to me as a mathematician and the algorithms needed in data science through the exercises in the textbook I have been thinking recently that I would like to get a textbook on the probability used in statistics such as a textbook in probability theory and random processes is this something you would recommend Also are there any machine learning or other textbooks in statistics you would recommend Many thanks First time watching your content And I have to say these are not tutorials but they are Thanks Krish Nike for introducing Ken jee Hey Ken do you have any videos on data generation simulation and augmentation This guy looks like Cody Ko and Noel Miller combined views Really These videos are highly highly underrated Keep up the good work Ken Very awesome to hear all your perspectives on data science Really happy that everyone is collaborating and very supportive Hello im a beginner I want to learn data scientist Maybe any tips for everyone n Great to see U three on same platform Looking forward to get one end to end project by one from U all I have been following Ken and Krish for a long time So glad to see this collab At u made a great point Ken Wish recruiters realize this thing this session was great Its good to see DS's collaborating and sharing der views from diff geography Good Effort Man UVA vest I left my phone on all night and woke up to this great video thanks man have done and so far Kaggle YouTube channel am gonna play around with the other suggestions I got so many answers from this thank you Usually background music makes videos bad But seriously your skill of applying background music is awesome which makes the watching experience really great Interesting video I m about to start college and I was wondering if I could get a professional data scientist opinion on what to study I am planning on majoring in Data Science and I m thinking of double majoring with a Psychology BS and maybe even a public policy minor My goal is to work for the CIA NSA in the future but I also am still young and this might change I also think working in politics as a data scientist would be very interesting and a rewarding career This being said I don t want to restrict myself and would like to keep my options open I m very passionate about all three disciplines but Data Science is my top priority Thanks for the advice Krish Naik Ken Jee and Data Professor are underrated and deserve more recognition than u know whoever is dominating the current programming domain on youtube as a millionaire Thanks alot for helping those who aspire to be a data scientist or similar E This is such a cool guide I'm studying data science and psychology at a university and this video is a great overview of what I can do over the summer or during down time in order to increase my knowledge and skill set Looking forward to future videos Am new to the DS environment and the setting up of the repo and all had already overwhelm me And the nitty gritty details to amend the code Hope I am able to digest and pick up as I continue my upskilling What major scientist you are I just wonder I have question about my senior class What feature engineering actually means love krish sir I can't remember who made the comment but if you say the title of data scientist will become like web developer in the future that is not a bad guess Ubiquitous but still an important set of skills I'm following both Ken Jee sir and Krish Naik sir both are very helpful in data science Thank you both of you for providing the guidence to the newer data science students Thank you Ken Jee and Krish Data Professor very excited to subscribe to your channel I'm enjoying Kaggle I just finished the intro to Python and Machine Learning It's really beginner friendly Amazing colab Hope you start an interview series soon Krish Naik is Love As a person in last year of school i found out recently about data science unlike artificial intelligence or programming i coudnt seem to under what data science does can u please link any articles which might intrest a student trying to pursue engineering Thanks a lot for this please create more these type of short discussions from India Thanks Krish KenJee and Data Professor for your time for sharing the knowledge All the very best for the krish for his new Assignment oh wow I am follower from Egypt I love your channels and most welcome to your great guest I recently begin in data science I need your advice and help to guide my steps how can I arrange it Now I begin to study with IBM and later I get MBA degree is it useful for the study of data science I have the passion but I just confused about the steps and the right way Thanks for the helpful video Thank you for your video Can you please post a video on how to prepare for Kaggle Competitions Thanks How hard is it to understand we take your information sell it to advertisers while giving it to the DNC for free the end Thanks for this video Kenjee Thanks to you I also found Data Professor and Krish Naik The three of you are awesome You all have your own uniqueness and different qualities as Youtubers Sir background music was not necessary great content Ken Greetings from Argentina Can you give me some end to end project ideas I am aware of that I need to gather data clean data etc but can you give me some project ideas in the space of nlp and supervised learning problems Is a Question answering bot of data science interview questions a good portfolio project what is the normal job profile of someone working in sports analytics domain I watch all of you so this is great Probably this collaboration will lead to more collaboration and working with more people in the data science community This is a very well explained video I am trying to get the tweets of one specific user but the 'user' parameter that you mentionned doesn't seem to work any ideas on how I could achieve this thanks What What is your computer keyboard model Hey you Ken Really nice channel you have here You've got one more subscriber Here in Brazil we have this kind of discussion every day And for the ones who is not from the field but really passionate about data and the math behind it and of course have enough time to do so won't you recommend a second bachelor related to the field For example Statistics Computer Science Mathmatics and so on Briefly I think for the tools softwares programming languages there are no better place to learn them than in online courses Thus the bachelor would give us the theory we need and in parallel sharp our skills with online courses I'm curious to know your opinion about it Cheers from Brazil buddy I feel like I'm camping out in front of a store on Black Friday morning waiting for it to open so I can snag that amazing deal I've seen being advertised all week Can't wait to see this video How do u think an economist can develop as a data scientist Regards from Spain How about the courses on edureka Thanks for this initiative Ken I am following you and DataProfessor for a longTime You are both doing great to the community I have one question to Ask I am from Engineering Background Learn Programing and DataScience Skills is not a big Task For me But How to get Domain Knowledge as Domain Knowledge is very important as you say everytime Actually I am intrested in Finance Agriculture domain How to get this Domain Knowledge I know this question irrelevant to ask But I want to have a clarity on this Hope You will see this clarify Thank you Kim DataProfessor and Krish naik Sir Cant wait my favorite data science channel so eager for this How to get a remote data science job Hi Ken I've been watching your videos and really have enjoyed them I am currently doing an internship in a startup that's developing insect farms insects for human consumption mostly crickets I'm majoring in Industrial Engineering started my internship in more of a production stand point but due to the pandemic I've redefined the project for a data driven improvement In the last couple of months I've helped the company with its data collection and aggregation methodologies and tools That has led me to be really interested in deepening my knowledge into data science I'm currently working on the Coursera Data Specialization Courses and will be applying the tips that you've shared in your channel Keep the good work Pura Vida lol someone didnt agree Thanks for the video it gave me good understanding of how to continue my learning Excited for this Ken Jee Thanks for organizing this It was a great discussion You forgot your name in the video title I think many less skilled persons can take on most data science positions as long as they learn the powerful libraries available So what's there for the specialists What's stupidity the stupidity when you press dislike before you watching the video Thanks for your effort guys and for those who pressed dislike go far away Looking forward to Good video I plan to start masters in Data Science in summer of What music are you using for the transitions in your videos It's pretty groovy I had a great time speaking with Krish Naik and The Data Professor Hopefully this conversation will lead to future collaborations down the road In the comments please let us know what you thought of the conversation and if you would like to see more content similar to this I wasn't able to answer all the questions in the chat please send them to me via twitter kenJee DS and I will do another video answering them Krish Naik's Channel https www youtube com user krishnaik Data Professor's Channel https www youtube com channel UCV e g IWQqK bbzGDEI Q Why earthquakes cannot be predicted by datascience You have enough data I am doing PhD in applied Mathematics modelling on system and control I am working with C Matlab Python I am pursuing my career as a data scientist data analyst Is there any growing field relates to data modeling In my case Is it essential to take certificate from like coursera edX And what is the main topics parts should have to complete Thanks Ken What about non free courses certificates or micrometers could you please some of the high quality but still affordable ones Thanks Great video Ken Started watching with little expectation but it turned out to be really informative following I can see a Mathematics book on your desk What level of Maths is it A Level or University first year What level of Mathematics does one need to have to go into Machine Learning I already watched the video but i am here for the second time For what I just wanted to thank you I loved Kaggle I wish i had started everything from there So thank you for telling about Kaggle D Hi Ken What keyboard shortcut did you click to run the program at where it showed the Chrome browser opening Thanks for this I was getting really into Statistics but I realized my time will be better spent doing projects can BERT be used for text metadata extraction Can a newbee get a remote data science role Hi Keen I just found your channel and watched some of your videos I love them Thank you for sharing these helpful insights about data science and your day to day routine i think the most important skill that distinguishes a data scientist from a developer is the ability to present and visualise results for the relevant stakeholders and summarise insights that allow the aforementioned to perform relevant decisions Hi may I ask how much hours do you normally spend on learning new data science knowledge everyday at the moment Thank you for these precious advices My ultimate goal is to publish at least one article in Journal of Machine Learning Research I've even got some ideas but it would be great to get some help about TeX thank you it was really helpful I want to learn python and get better at it by the end of the June Since I am already good with CPP I hope the ride would take up less time Hey Ken great video for a beginner like me thanks for your time and effort here wanted to check if you have any recommendations for the Statistics micro course thanks Phew I met up with a friend of a friend who was saying how much I needed to learn Java if I want to be a professional software engineer Which may be true but I want to pursue data science and I cling to my new python skills So glad I m not wasting my time I have a goal of building a model that can play chess using deep learning Wish me luck on my career shift I am a beginner in data science and would love to do a project based on astronomy Do you have any suggestions I love how quick to point your videos are Not enough YouTubers do this I love you Ken I have not paid attention to the series as it is focused on data science I am a data engineer just starting though not when I saw the th video of the series then I read the description There is so much to take away for this Thanks Specially thanks to you to share this valuable sites with us It's been months i stared learn python and planning to do my Master s On Data Science Thank you again Hello Ken I have a technical background but my specialization is Mechanical Also like every second Indian boy I follow and play cricket alot I came across your video and gave a thought to explore in this field Also while pursuing this career I think that choosing your favourite sport would be a good idea So as I mentioned without having any prior experience in the skillsets how can I prepare a roadmap for becoming a cricket performance analyst Will mathletics broaden the generalised view over sports analytics and help in relating to cricket as well to start of as a fresher I'd really appreciate your feedback on my questions Sir Thank you Hello Ken Great content How can I contact you I would like to discuss a little bit about the data scientist career path and your background is kinda similar to mine I also added you on LinkedIn Thank you Hi guys So it seems like this has stopped working I found the fix on Github tho Here's how to go about it This can be fixed by modifying the header dictionary in query py from HEADER 'User Agent' random choice HEADERS LIST to HEADER 'User Agent' random choice HEADERS LIST 'X Requested With' 'XMLHttpRequest' that should fix the issue Here's the github link https github com taspinar twitterscraper issues Ken will you kindly pin this comment for everyone's good Cheers PS query py can be found typically at C ProgramData Anaconda Lib site packages twitterscraper MNIST isn t pixels x pixel images pixels total which are the input neurons in this case Is there any place where modelling and graphing is taught as well Like if I wanted to simulate the motion of billiard balls on a table Hi Ken Day and night I have worked hard for my transition towards data science from a System Engineer It's almost days over and I have recorded my observations and redefined my resume Please Verify it and give me your valuable suggestion https github com aspiringmind https www linkedin com in subramani arumugam b If possible please provide me your email id Thanks for the video I run the following tweets query tweets Trump begindate begin date enddate end date limit limit lang lang INFO queries 'Trump since until ' INFO Got tweets new received tweets would you happen to know why Hi Ken for learning data science which programming language you suggest Python or R I can't say I'm good in math but I can confidently say I'm not afraid of it I'm excited Hi Ken am a beginner I just want to know if this case study can be added in my resume after learning it thoroughly haha when I first started out I was like omg I feel like such a fraud but now I don't mind Great video as always Hi Ken thanks for sharing the video it's clear and gets rigth to the point However though I follwed each step once I try to run the code I always get the following output INFO Got tweets new INFO Got tweets new regardless of query limit or language used Do you have any idea of why this happens your channel is so cool can we subscribe each other and be friends How are the one on Coursera I am auditing those ones ken want videos about intersection between sports analytics and data science I really want to explore that side first i am now training my basics What would you say are the prerequisites for kaggle Thankyou so much Sir Hi Ken I d be interested in a live stream for career review feedback Thanks I have another question do you think kaggle kernels are a valid substitute to GitHub projects Cause you can use kernels to show your thought process among other stuff Like having descriptive kernels based on the projects you recommend above would be suitable for

very valuable channels in Youtube Thank you SSMS can not be implemented on MAC OS is there any other tools that I could use on the MAC OS THANKS Ken this is another great and incredibly useful video Ken which keyboard do you use Keep up the good work many people have watched your videos down in Brazil Good job on that Could you share the title of the books on your desk Great video thanks I want to learn data science but is not from IT back ground and I learn from scratch How did you learn complicated feature engineering Through reading kaggle kernels Yo thank you for the video really appreciated Thanks a lot Ken I have a question for you Could you please give me a tip on how I can add an HTML file in the post md working path and command example Again I always appreciate your help The best video on scraping tweets Easy to understand However I could scrape tweets only for a day The next day onwards every time I run the code it returned tweets What could be the possible reason and how could I rectify it The result was same irrespective of the topic or timeline Thanks Hi Ken Jee Request you to put more videos on a data science real intermediate level projects As everyone is talking about projects in ML DL NLP but nobody is talking about real life projects in small and medium size industry or free lancers Not big ones like IBM Oracle who can spend lot of money to build products Everyone is talking about titanic housing price predictions diabetics etc Looking for new exiting real life projects which we can implement from our home to start testing it Pl comment and suggest BTW your videos are awesome Keep it up Inspekt labs They lowered down the cost to per claim Sir I have one suggestion to help the data science community You can show real world tech startups use DS ML CV to do there business I came across this startup they automate insurance claim of vehicles Inspekt labs This will help the people have some hope and they can look forward to start something of there own https www linkedin com posts devesh trivedi a insurtech carrental carsharing ugcPost q h Hi Ken Thanks for the tips I am working as a developer in cloud and python with years of experience I have Bachelors in CS Iam currently pursuing the edx Data Science Micromasters from MIT Its same lecture as MIT classroom program in Datascience There are topics Statistics Probability Machine Learning Data Analysis for Social Scientists Is this a good path to go forward for good chances of Getting a job in Machine Learning positions or Data Science Positions Are these skills helpful in the data science roles Thanks for this series I have always felt intimated by the whole process of data analysis and model building this series gave me plenty of confidence to step up my efforts in the field and focus more on projects as well Thanks Also what is the font that you're using in Jupyter Lab Hey this is a super helpful video I am trying to do the same using datetime date today so I don't have to keep updating the day but the twitterscraper module only seems to be able to search when the date is formatted with commas and no leading zeroes as you have done do you have any idea how to get this to work hey ken apart from docker and sagemaker can you make a video based on what we can learn now that will help us in production stage I am pursuing a bachelors degree in statistics Is it a good idea to get a minor in business with elective classes and supporting classes of computer science or just get a minor in computer science Thank you Please how do you update the portfolio after it has been created qwerqwerqwer Really informative keep posting Ken Hi Ken i need your honest opinion man I'm confused in choosing between Data Scientist or UX Designer There are few questions about this topic but i want to ask from different perspective I am right now a content creator was a videographer so i do edit videos and such Visualization is always a part of me i like to vizualize things like when i hear music i can imagine the videos that fits the music But what i asked is much bigger than that I know lots of people talk about what you're more into if maths go with data science if creative go with ux design However i want to know how's the life of both careers Which one offer better work life balance Because when i did creative work i didn't really have work life balance i did a lot of overwork stuffs because creative work sometimes requires you to think constantly or out of the box that really absorbed your attention even outside of your work hours When i go outside my body is in holiday mode but my mind is not there thinking of the unfinished project Then second which one is more important and irreplaceable Because i see lots of websites now offering design templates which mean maybe in the future companies don't really need ux designer since they can use good templates from the internet Third when you become the CEO of the company Which skill is best to master Data science or ux design That will absolute critical as someone in that position Like to hear your thoughts about this thank you So on st May I searched youtube for Data science portfolio website and found this awesome video posted just days before I have made my first portfolio website thanks to you guys Thank you One heads up for anyone making their own site in this way After uploading files some of the images might not load on the page when run using Github pages This happens because some images that were uploaded have the src images To get the photos simply edit the index html file for the pages where the images are missing Change the images to https dataprofessor github io Ken Portfolio images and the images will show This was something I faced and that's how I fixed it Hope this helps and hope you all make the website you want This video is interesting in a different way to me I am Data Scientist but if I want to start over as a Game Developer I m so glad I stumbled on your channel I m a data science student right now and I love how detailed your videos are I m starting a data science statistics channel soon and excited to be one of the few women POC data science channels on YouTube would love to possibly chat with you either through a video collab or a call Let me know if you re interested Always looking to learn more within the data science community wow you were just k a few weeks ago and now you are k congrats Man as a newbie I can't thank you enough for this playlist Helped me wrap loose concepts altogether currently learning data analytics on Udemy but most of the data used are already sources I just have to import them into SQL or excel or Power BI I opened Kaggle for the first time yesterday and I was lost Didn't know where to start from or what to do Thanx So I'm trying to be a data scientist eventually and I know from experience I don't like software engineering but I do really enjoy the role I had as a data analyst intern Would you say looking for a job as a data analust is a good way to gzt your foot in the door to work up to data scientist eventually I also can't afford to do an advanced degree Thank you for this This is very helpful Excellent analysis as always Ken I'm doing a masters in astrophysics right now it's a lot of experience coding with large datasets is that good enough to pursue a career in data science or should I look into some of these other options Ken I really enjoy seeing the Project Review episodes Wondering if you saw my email which I sent to kenjee ds gmail I sent it on and it would be coming from royal sasan Thanks again for this wonderful channel Hi congratulations for your channel I have problems when I upload my public file in github it generates the web but without the ananke structure could you know why Thanks Good videos following Ken makes me motivated towards projects but I am new to this field Thanks Ken for reviewing my project this will help me a lot Some wrote that I'm not a beginner but it s true I started coding for the first time with the beginning of the pandemic in March I enjoyed it and also I had nothing else to do in the lockdown so I invested whole days in learning Python Data Science Watched a lot of tutorials with x speed Ken s project series from scratch inspired me to start my own project The result you can see in this video But it was a lot of time and effort to get to this point So it s a nice compliment when someone thinks that my project can t be from a beginner Also I hope this motivates people who are now at the beginning Hey Ken I m a newbie in DS field and just getting started with my studying Which online platform would u recommend to start from What r ur thoughts on Dataquest Sir you can thoroughly give example like a case study of cool data science products Those guys who made products would have insights about there journey and selling there service Hello I have just completed learning concepts and algorithms of ML and deep learning But after this I really find no way to step forward although I tried picking up some projects from kaggel but in that too I faced a lot of problems and felt like a end So can there be a specific journey defined for a learner to enter implementation phase after completing the learning phase Thanks for the video You speak clearly I worked in the Financial world for years Last year I signed up for a course of Data Analyst and I loved it so much i decided to change my career and starting from zero In my own experience this thing of stablishing goals helped me a lot I started with an online course of statistics now i'm learning Python and starting a business project with a friend Videos like this reenforces the steps we are taking and the path i choosed Its great help I will continue watching your videos Thanks words can describe thanks ken Hey Ken I'm new to the data science so I wanted to ask you a question A lot of people say that the most important thing that data scientist should make is value However I saw a lot of popular notebooks on Kaggle with complex algorithms but without any explanation of the reasoning behind them e g doing sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews but without mentioning why it might be beneficial So my question is Is explaining the reasons behind your actions and mentioning the value of your work important I am really interesting in data science but unfortunately I'm very bad at math and statistic is there any chance that I can made it Thanks for the content This is awesome I m starting out learning programming for data analyst Udacity data analyst course I have my bs in mechanical engineering and am a process engineer for a Pharma company So going through my own course work and seeing other people s work with your explanation is very beneficial Thank you datasciencejay 's video How to Land a Data Science Job Without Experience My New Grad Story https www youtube com watch v v Szio r E Thanks Ken for another great video Agreed great analysis by Daniel and it's amazing that he can do this in just months of coding Hello What if I don't have any programming experience How harder the journey will be Thanks For bringing up these kind of vidoes gives us the motivation to make Data Sciences projects even for a beginner like me Amazing analysis Especially considering he only has months of coding experience This is such an informative video Thanks for sharing your knowledge I am interested in learning about Data Science Finance Any financial engineers on this channel Such a great series to follow Getting to the point where I'll feel confident enough to submit a project soon this guy is a legend I dont think this guy is new to coding Great video Just sent you my time series analysis project I hope you can review it Special thanks to Daniel for letting me review his portfolio If you would like to have your portfolio or resume reviewed please comment below and send an email to kenjee ds gmail com Mohamed's github https github com zeglam Countries GDP prediction Hi Ken I love all your tutorials but in this one I am facing some problems I keep getting the error 'ModuleNotFoundError No module named 'selenium' ' on the console I would like to master Python for finance in the next month Hey Ken Which company do you work for or you work as a full time freelancer Thanks dear for your video I am a beginner in data science I have passion about it computer science isn't my present career or study and and I don't have any experience how long does it take to learn and work in data Thanks in advance Hello Ken Jee thank you for your effort to teach people in the data science journey I personally give my appreciation to you because your video is really helpful Most YouTubers make me confused but your video is very neatly arranged I think we have the same persona you are a people that always do everything in a structure and very careful Therefore it is comfortable with your video If there is any chance I really want to be your apprentice in the data science journey fantastic video If I'm ever able to land a data science job it'll be because of you Dear Ken I have done my UG in Biology Science and currently studying in Bioinformatics for masters degree I have totally no experience in coding before master but now I have some experience in Python SQL R and machine learning but very basic My summer internship got canceled due to the pandemic and I'm worried about my lack of experience in real work job when I graduate this winter Bioinformatics maybe a bit different and I'd really appreciate to hear your suggestion I truly feel ashamed while typing this text but what do you literally mean saying project I mean for instance I think an original idea and then collect relatively data from sources then create a model for prediction Or I just choose a Kaggle Project and try to accomplish the aim as good as I can Which one does count for a resume THANKS FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCE AND THOUGHTS BTW greetings from Turkey thanks legend Also I am a Full Time commerce student I don't do Physical science Can I still pursue a bcom applied Mathematics degree without knowledge of Physical science or should I perhaps just go with statistical learning bcom mathematical sciences I am very Interested in Data Science Not for money instead I never even thought of That I'd say I am good at Maths creative with good presentation skills and yes I do love helping and working together with others to solve problems but I'm not good with computers Can I learn to do that Am I taking a risk I have to be an expert in python for data analyst Ty Great content Ideal foundation for DS roles in the long term would be MS in Statistics with electives in Computer Science or vice versa In parallel you must network and hopefully get a summer internship Starting out as an Analyst is solid foundation in ETL development visualization and telling a story I've been in the game since years Anyone wants to ask questions please contact And definitely subscribe to this channel Hi I am not sure what the project was about after doing EDA Did he try to predict the actual true gdp by using only the most relevant features in the data like the number of phones etc Sorry if this is a dumb question Hey Ken What did you do with the UFC Could you create a video or share that on Github Thanks thanks Can you give some options of good masters certificates Bootcamps Hi Ken I'm an experienced financial controller with a MSc in business administration and I took a leave of months I am looking for a career change to data science and already did udacity Programming for data science in Python I only have until october to focus on this career change and was thinking taking the ironhack bootcamp for data analytics https www ironhack com en data analytics After october with my demanding job and kids will be impossible for me to study I'm looking to be ready for a data analytics role as an entrance in data science market Do you approve in my case to be the best approach Thanks I am a studying M Sc in lighting engineering I want to be a data scientist How hard it would be Thanks for the video I m double majoring in finance and computer science At first I was so lost I didn t know where or how to get help with internship I ended up getting an internship at a well known fintech company I learned a lot Why haven't I found you till now thanks for coming into my life Would be best if you make a practical tutorial for beginners Dude i like ur videos Improvement hint add keyword text to ur videos it gets better to understand Hi Ken can you explain why on one hand getting lost in the pack of people with these degrees is a concern but within years it wont be an issue what do you mean by that can being a introvert will effect the data scientist All of ur videos are really helpful and educational Hope your channel grow real fast Nice video For a beginner is it better jumping to data science while learning programming or getting better at software engineering first and going data science thereafter great content Ken more like a therpy for data science learners loved the way you exlained while working through Hey I'm a recent EE graduate who's been expanding my knowledge of Python and learning a little SQL through quarantine and I'm thinking of switching into the data science field I've done some ML and deep learning research before but I feel like I'm missing some of the fundamentals although I'm filling them in as fast as I can I got into a pretty good year master's program but I'm wondering your take because I do have a bit of an analytical background in engineering and I would love to consider a bootcamp or a certificate for the sake of time especially if I can get started during quarantine Any tips Thank you so much Such an amazing channel and great content Thank you for sharing hello I have a project or idea in mind It uses the concept of Text Analysis Can someone here guide me what concepts should I cover before jumping into the project I have a very basic knowledge of Python pls help Thanks for such great content in a simple crisp precise package I've only watched like videos of your channel It's praiseworthy how you deliver precise content without much of visualization in such a

Science career After watching your video it helped me a lot it has changed my mindset Thanks for helping the community God bless you please keep posting Great video thanks for sharing Best Thanks for sharing these resources Follow up question any advice on how to either find a data science mentor or group to collaborate with I ve been practicing on my own but think there s real benefit from connecting with more advanced professionals to get feedback and keep advancing but am having a hard time figuring out how to get started here i watched your video and quite i understand many things but when i hit f key it is showing an error ModuleNotFoundError No module named 'twitterscrapper Please help me ASAP https crazyphoton github io vikas portfolio my site is not working data professor Been enjoying your channel Found it last week Thanks Ken i recently subscribed and appreciate the informative videos Some background I have a background in Math BS Chem Engineering BS and have been working in a data engineer analyst role for the past years at a major automotive company Although I have a strong quant background I feel like I need to hone my coding skill set to get to the next level in my work currently familiar with some R matlab tableau PowerBi I am considering a online MS analytics from Georgia Tech for its curriculum reputation cost K also it would be nice to have the added benefit credibility of a MS If you were me and wanting to strengthen your coding skill set to get to the next level in data analysis what route would you take And have you heard about Georgia Tech s online program at I am not able to change my name on localhost I m an analyst for telco however I use sql and power BI to do standard analysis with basic methods I don t have any R or Python experience so where should I start as I want to learn how to create and use models Ken Jee posts a video on youtube step Like the video step watch the video Awesome stuff as always man currently I am in nd year of engineering and I know tableau power bi python Django and I learn and explore mL after I completed my engineering it is possible to get on role data scientist job with master's I mean After or years because I can't afford my Master degree is it possible sir To get job in good company For a beginner is it ok to focus on Kaggle problems Or should one explore LeetCode and other such websites It all gets overwhelming My mac is not opening hugo exe file because it says its from an unrecognised source Can someone help me out here For a field that is growing you provide awesome content for people to navigate through it Your help is much appreciated My question is in regards how to get into data science Data Science Bootcamp which includes programming requirements Use that knowledge to work on projects freelancing build portfolio Start with a full stack development software engineering bootcamp get experience there and then slowly transition to data science Coming from a civil engineering background with little to no coding experience what sounds better Congratulations for this partnership you both are creating awesome content and helping a lot of people This saved my butt I was searching all over the net for how to use Spyder in different environments and nobody had explained it properly Thanks Ken Ur a true inspiration to people who strive to achieve greatness th comment This was quite helpful thanks for posting This came at a perfect time Only today I was trying to build a website from scratch and wanted to embed my work into it Then I looked at website building platforms like weebly and jimdo ughh thanks loads I have an undergrad degree in computer science do you recommend a master in data science even though I have zero experience in the field This was exactly what I was looking for and k subs so happy for you you deserve it man Keep it up Super like These demos are so useful and pragmatic Does this render Altair visualitions like fastai fastpages And what about Jupyter Notebook I have an electronics engineering degree but work as a biomedical technician in a hospital Haven t used any coding since college but use a lot of exceI I was thinking of getting a data science specialization course and then a masters in data science at the end of the year School can be partially covered by my employer I was thinking about moving into an analytics or data engineering role at my hospital Would that be a good route Thank you simple answer Bootcamp I speak from experience I have only credits left to finish my MS Computer Science degree and I can tell you right from the bat I learn more about tools that I will actually use on the job market from youtube not from my masters classes Bootcamp is more hands on You learn by working on projects not reading some text book and doing a quiz The answers to the quizzes are on quizlet anyways Hi Ken is it better to learn JS HTML and CSS to land a machine learning engineering job or is it a waste of time Hi Ken Is it better to learn HTML CSS and JavaScript to land a machine learning engineering job or is it a waste o time Hi Ken is it better to learn JavaScript HTML and CSS to be a machine learning engineer or is it a waste of time Good evening Sir Ken Jee I must say that you have been most helpful to many here and I deeply appreciate it I have a BS and MS in Pharmacology and Toxicology biomedical sciences and I hope to transition into the data science field With zero coding experience and a fair knowledge of math how do you suggest I begin Sir Also what online courses with links would you suggest I start with Is data science site good enough Kaggle seems to jump right into machine learning and thus I'm quite wary So pleaser Sir could you kindly shed some light Thanks Is there any way I can show Kaggle on the main page near LinkedIn and Youtube channel I tried pasting Kaggle URL but it is not showing on the website Always with a great content Thanks man I would learn almost anything for k I would clean toilets put stickers on car parts hold a sign on the side of the road eat wasabi whatever You can buy a full sized house after only a couple years of savings with that kind of money Most Americans haven't had that standard of living for years I only hear rich people say that you shouldn't do x for the money It would be more convincing to hear that from somebody who quit a data scientist job to go work at Walmart This video is pretty reassuring Great content as always Bro this is awesome This is the type of content I've been trying to find Your channel is so informational and practical please keep uploading Hello Ken I am vivek from India i am right now learning the big data course and wanted to go become a sports analyst can you help me how to go in that field I have completed my basic python and will be learning all the programming language in my curriculum Can you help me in projects like how to build the projects and what kind of books should i read Awaiting for your response Thanks for sharing knowledge and awaiting for your response I am getting a B S in Econ CS and a minor in Math I plan to do a bootcamp after i finish my degrees Does that seem like a good mix to get a job after i finish all of theses Thanks for the detailed roadmap it definitely helps some of us who are looking to pivot to a data science career these days QQ Do you think a MBP i gb would be enough to learn and do all of these Thanks again for these What are some of the relevant bootcamp programs that you would recommend Awesome vid Very informative and straightforward Thank you Thank you so much bro it s very informative especially for someone who doesn t any background on Data Analyst Science Most likely I m receiving a lot of negative feedback that it s too late for me to learn programming since I m too old Gosh I m turning in few more months time it s ticking need to start soon Wish me luck hopefully I could start my journey and will work out finely then soon become successful in entirety Finally a collab between Ken and Data Professor Great to see the two DS heroes working together to help this community Definitely following this tutorial Truly grateful for your insights and advice in this video It's fantastic Just wondering what are your thoughts regarding the Data Science course Cheers Not even two minutes in and I already hit the like button Found my extra project for the weekend Thank you both Also like Ken said The Data Professor has awesome videos on virtual internship opportunities that are FREE Great opportunity especially for college students Finally thank you so much Ken Jee I was waiting for this I have been working on making a portfolio website The skeleton is ready However I have yet to host it on github I also have yet to upload my data science projects to github When I do in about a month or so would it be okay if you took a look at it and gave suggestions on one of your Monday episodes Is hugo better than Gatsby Very nice Aman omg i just realise when i took my machine learning course in school the titanic dataset was used Again special thank you to the Data Professor for working with me to produce this video https www youtube com channel UCV e g IWQqK bbzGDEI Q For the more basic website version check out this video https www youtube com watch v aXk RViq c Hey Ken I'm currently a grad student studying econ and finance and am just starting to utilizing data science to research at a higher level What would you suggest is a good path is to cover the core basics of data science My current idea of a 'best path' is SQL R Python and then focusing on packages like tableau and Tensorflow What are your thoughts suggestions Could also do a video on this Thanks The best Great Will a double degree in top CS and Stats programs in undergraduate kind of close to BS MS Thanks Hey Ken I have an experience of years as an analyst and have just enrolled for Ms in data science remotely from Liverpool John Moore's university is that worth it One thing i realised with DS and DL it that that they are not just technical field but a business domain as well you can not create a better ML model only based on technology you need to know about business terms and what contributes in growth of that particular domain do you agree You did McIntyre I did a couple electives there Though the classes were a lot softer than my main DS classes thanks friend just finished a BS in economics and I appreciate your insight especially nowadays it's the best time to reskill hey bro I'm very much afraid of coding but I want to do masters in data science and now I started learning programming is it be worthful Ridiculous mic Completely useless Hey Ken I have done my UG in computer science years ago currently an eSports coach starting my master's degree in eSports this fall I want to be able to track player performance using game data also analysing game data which will help me give a deeper understanding of of my team's performance So far I have been doing this in a very pain staking method of gathering a few key points of data and the comparing them on paper I am confused as to if I should start certificate program's or just start learning a software such as SQL or python I'd really appreciate to hear your suggestion What do you recommend MS in Computer Science or MS in Data Science Business Analytics Hi there Ken I really appreciate your content I am a biomedical scientist who is beginning to use R studio Do you have any suggested freely available content like that described in this video for the R platform which you feel is really solid or underrated YT algorithm brought me here Amazing content and advice subscribed Hi Ken Im currently working on my first regression analysis first concrete data science project really but I m being pretty thorough Would you like to review it It s an assessment for my stats class but most of what I do is not required since we have more concrete data science classes next year It is due in Sunday so if you are interested I can provide it for you Just keep in mind it s a first for me Hey Ken What can I use in a Mac since SQL Server is not available for Macs I hate collaborating but the reason why I want to take data science is because I want to end up in AI research Hi i have a masters degree in Marketing major and i had year experience in sales I wanted to switch my carrier to Data science will the degree experience help me in my carrier transition to Data science Black box algorithms such as Neural networks I'm an accouting that wants to become in a DS do you think this combo works a comment Great video and great suggestions Ken Keep it up Amazing thanks so much Awesome as always I found this one particularly interesting because it was well documented and went rather in depth It shows that you can always do something to spice up your projects On a different note how many hours do you actually work to create one video It is really incredible how you've kept up with consistent uploads for over a year and I am just curious about how much time this takes for you Thanks ken your videos are just great l'm planning to become a data analytic any recommendations for specific channels and courses please cause I just feel I'm lost do you think its important to learn data structures and algorithm you are chill and compose and like DJ Khaled would say I appreciate you I'm trying to navigate how to teach myself python with the goal of becoming a data scientist Your channel is a goldmine of great information thanks for all of your help please make a video on best projects to attract recruiters post covid Hi Ken Could you please make a video on Covid prediction to attract recruiters post covid Thanks in advance Great video bro Hey I wanna become a data analyst Can I do these projects too or should I try out a different set of projects Hey Ken I'm getting the following error when I run the file ElementNotInteractableException element not interactable element has zero size Session info chrome Can you suggest a solution please How important is it to have a master's degree for getting a job I'm currently an undergrad CS major with a Stats minor and I honestly feel like I can learn what I need online without a master's so I just started learning about data science your videos help me a lot to get the insights Thanks for those and I had a question that would you recommend me to do the IBM Specialization on data science as a beginner Can someone from Visual arts background pursue data science without a science degree If yes how must once start Would you be able to make more videos related to data analysis I've recently subscribed and love your vids man However I'm not looking to become a data scientist per se but rather a data analyst I would love to watch more videos ofyours regarding this topic I know you have a few already though Muchas gracias este video esta muy bien explicado suscrito Is this possible to apply a custom loss function in a regression model I'm working on a stock market prediction model and I need to maximize the following loss function if predicted actual then predicted else actual Would that be possible Thanks I wonder how much speaking the word algorithm helps out with the algorithm Hey Ken i got an idea for a project to work on my own i posted it on the comment section of the video prior to that one but just in case you only check comments of your most recent video can i send an elaborated version of my idea via email so you can have a quick look and give me a little bit of insight Thanks Hey Ken Did you pursue ms in computer science after mba degree Was your second degree mba How long typically the inperson interviews Hello Ken I face problem after building a model that is I am struggling to enhance my accuracy My data overfits and my accuracy keeps on stuck there and then and there's no one to guide me What to do I also took statistics times and became an econ major what a journey I just stumbled on your videos and I must say the contents are really insightful I will try to watch asmuch as possible and let you know what my questions are Thank you Loved the part where you mentioned how him including small personal details on his GitHub such as how he likes Chess can have such an influential factor on people looking at his profile Will definitely reference this video again in the future Loved how you switched up the introduction of the video Your getting better with each upload Ken I like the monitor Can anyone provide some specs Do you recommend it over PyCharm Any tips on how do you put or phrase these self initiated learned projects into resumes Since it is hard to show their impact Hi Ken What techniques should I use to create scores for data So for example given a hotel and points of interest around the hotel create a score for each hotel on its night life activity hi sir please tell some data science bootcamp source What is your opinion on someone who pursuing a data science career without a degree I'm currently self learning by buying course online and planning on attending a bootcamp in the next year hi sir i want to step in this world of data But i don't know where to start from can you help me out please Thank you so much for making these very informational and insightful videos I m a rising college freshman and I foresee myself watching all your videos as I begin self learning data science this summer break I want to start machine learning and I have very limited knowledge of programming how do you think I should start Thank you so much for sharing how to start as a carrer in Data Science without college learn online more knowledge please info do you read research paper's as part of your job Books The Rule by Tommy Baker Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker PhD Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke Poker champion The Disciplines of Execution Mathletics by Winston Ultralearning by Scott H Young Sprawlball See also Kaggle com thanks man you are a life saver Believe it or not I subscribe your channel for top reasons your face your sounds and data science Thank me later Amazing video I've been following the whole steps and learning a lot P S Sometimes we cannot se the bottom of the screen when you're typing Well it seems to me that this video is far better than any of all of the other videos on similar topics Straight to the point clear precise in the right way I just wonder why so few visualizations Is being good at advanced math really needed to learn Python Nice work you should do it more often very practical and informative Great info love how you broke this down I spent years studying data science it was like my own masters Most of the courses were from Udacity I really reccomend their nanodegrees because you do a lot of projects and you can add them to your portfolio Ken Thank you so much for these videos I have an issue when plotting the hist the x axis takes from year to How can I fix that Is a week enough for normal people to complete one project D I want to study machine learning and I m familiar with Javascript will python be much better or not Hey Ken What IDLE is on A lot of content over the internet about DS was uploaded more than years ago So sometimes I think that I lost my opportunity to begin DS career So the thing that you upload your videos right now is the new light to me Thank you The best video that I have ever seen in this field I am new here and I want to start learning All the best As a self learner I'd say your vids are really helpful First off there's something calming about your voice Secondly the way you guide regarding the projects helps me set a clear path rather than rush into things and panick Keep up the God's work your are doing Thanks can you make a video on how to scrape a lazy loading website Do I still have a chance to go for data science if I am not gud at maths Can someone make sport prediction analytics Is data science useful in sports too How s EDA done for image based problems Is it possible to get an internship after your first year or should I save my efforts and wait for my second year Awesome stuff man I am from Boston and making the switch over to Data Science Love the content I love your videos and the channel but get very distracted by your eyes flickering when you read the script I don't know if it's just me I think it would be a better experience to just have a VoiceOver or something or maybe putting the script in notes format in front of you occasionally looking down is okay Thanks and keep up Q I don't have any particular degree of statistics or computer science but I liked statistics a lot and have encountered in school to graduation days Now I want to dive in data scinece domian So my question is that certification or micro masters or masters degree which one of this courses give me a push for jobs and good career path for data science Thanks for your content Thanks for the video Ken My goal is to learn data science from scratch since I have a lot of spare time at the moment and I'm hoping to move careers somepoint soon Thank you for your insight Hey I wish to become a sports analyst and I've basic knowledge about programming Can u guide me on how to reach my goal starting from scratch Theres another site called AIcrowd which is pretty good as well First of all thank you for your great content Beautifully explained I came across an issue when I run data collection py after progress it shows the following errors selenium common exceptions ElementNotInteractableException Message element not interactable element has zero size Session info chrome Can you please help I tried slack but still stuck Thank you again for your content Really appreciated Thank you Ken this is very helpful You seem very driven to self improvement as well so will check out those vids as well I am not a data scientist or interested in it but i do a bit of data analysis in my field of learning and development I primarily use R and I would encourage people not to shy away from R It's different from pythion because it is a domain specific language while python is a general purpose language R has some great packages such as the Tidyverse which allows very easy exploration of data Also you can use R and Python together That was a windy day Thank you Hi Your videos are really helpful But I m unable to find the correct order to watch them Can you help here For practical implementation of ML one must start with fast ai Machine learning or Udacity course for Machine Learning Nanodegree If you use jupyter lab there is an extension to spell check your markdown cells It is quite useful Your videos are great for beginners to learn data science Great work man Hi Ken I have started learning data science and this video was very useful I completed a course on basics of python for data science on udemy Can i attempt any of the projects that you mentioned Or do i need to learn any other skills Very informative and to the point I'm very grateful to you for such well explained and beneficial info that cut to the core of learning Data Science Ken thanks for all you do Would you recommend I learn a language like python first before I dive in to data science One of the best channel on YouTube for data science Lots of love man ur approach is very practical Good organization As an MBA graduate can i pursue a career in data science This is an amazing channel Glad I found it I m planning on majoring in data science this fall thank you for all the videos secs of video LIKE Great video I wish you make a video how to freelance as data scientist or data analysis for begineers Ken love the content brother Any chance you know a resource for analyzing running e g marathoning data Also is that an Oura ring you're wearing Thanks Awesome Thank you This video is really useful Hi Ken I have a request from you Increase size of codes script for who watching you on mobile please I know you sometimes zooming but thats not efficent Thank you I thumbed up and watched the video all the way through why because you also listed the things out in the description Most people want to clickbait you into watching the full video so they dont list the content in the description usually we have to go to the comments for someone to list them up So thank you its appreciated Hi Ken great video I m going to be getting my masters in business analytics starting in the fall and am trying to work on some projects this summer to get some more experience My goal is to work as a data analyst for a couple of years and then transition into data science Your channel is very informative for understanding this field and how to leverage Kaggle and github because my current experience level is just MIS analytics undergrad and internships It s really helpful to hear about these topics from someone with experience that isn t a professor Keep up the great work Ken Jee your content is awesome I feel you really did a great job covering some of the important aspects I worked as a Senior Data Scientist for some time and what really helped me get a lot of interviews was my research experience in ML and DS Hi I'm about to start a masters in data science in September this has been really useful Hi Ken can you talk about how to manage and overcome conflicts when working with a team of programmers It would be very helpful to get your input on this topic Thanks Great video gives me some structure to build my studying plan on As my background is in law I need to learn and revise some foundations is there a book you would recommend for revising necessary math Thank you very much The way you faced and solved the bugs is unique and inspirational Some other videos out there are too well prepared which is easy to delude people into the perfectness of the code Consequently if the code somehow does not run people don't know how to solve Please keep this style I noticed the books that you had on your desk What are your thoughts on Mathletics and Thinking in Bets I can also wait for a video book review I don't mind using your affiliate links I really like how you post your goals on the walls Did you have morning and evening routines up there too I've been cultivating morning routines for several years now and really feel the benefit from them You seem so organized Would you maybe do a video on how you track your goals in the excel spreadsheet Thanks for the interesting video I needed this thanks Ken I am not sure if this is legal cause the robots txt file at LinkedIn disallows everything on jobs Mostly every useful data to scrap is disallowed Will you review my project I haven't started but I would definitely would want to get reviewed for feedback Great series I'm trying it out after looking at your video I feel that the per hour salary is just for an hour While you have replaced the per hour with a blank Aren't we gonna convert the per hour to the actual salary By googling I found out that a data scientist in the US works almost hours Shouldn't we multiply this with the per hour salary and then with thank you I am just starting Data Sci and I'm done witu Python but I have a question that many people may have What fields of Math should I go for Calculus Mathematics Statistics Hi Ken I've been doing a data science bootcamp in London with Flatiron School This week is my final week and I have just finished my final capstone project I plan on applying for data science jobs very soon and I am trying to sort out my github projects so I can impress recruiters and companies I apply to I plan on changing my older projects to be structured and detailed like my capstone project and do the same for any new projects Could you review my capstone project please This is the github link to my capstone project https github com awesomeahi Hotel Review NLP Thanks been loving your videos very helpful hello thanks for your nice video imy education background fashion designer I wanna data scientist but I don't know how can I start please advise me Believe me bro you will have m subscribers soon keep going good luck Hi Ken This has been a really helpful series for me But how did the command touch work for you as it appears that it does not function in the Windows OS and is definitely not working for me very interesting video thank you Will a phd in data science add any extra value in my profile than that of a masters student with respect to industry related job The teacher I am new to data science and this series is helping a lot in how to structure my projects keep going i am watching your videos from past hour and it has cleared a lot of doubts of mine thank you you are on fire ken keep em coming also it would be kinda nice to start an interview questions series Hi Ken I am a freshman studying a bachelor in statistics Would you review projects in R what is considered as a project in data science industry Liking this Review series Absolutely agree with you at that tree based methods may be useful for giving feature importance but the lack of direction in which the features influences the model render it less useful than that of linear model's regression coefficients Recently I have been experimenting with the SHAP SHapley Additive exPlanations library https github com slundberg shap and it is filling this need by also giving the direction at which the feature influences the base values along with the magnitude as in linear models and the great thing is that it works on nearly all ML algorithms too tree based included Wow just found this channel amazing Thanks Those lists on your wall are really working See you in the Data Science world I'm tying to get better at explaining and documenting my work so this is a great example for future reference Thank you for sharing it Special thanks to Mohamed for letting me review his portfolio If you would like to have your portfolio or resume reviewed please comment below and send an email to kenjee ds gmail com Mohamed's github https github com zeglam Countries GDP prediction wide neck nigga Sir any mast degree is required for data scientist Any recommendations but for R software Instructions unclear I attempted to build AlphaGo from scratch but it's since become self aware and has left my server What do I do now For other people if you have the remote URL permission problem with SSH this website could help you https help github com en github using git changing a remotes url What if you aren't best programmers but enjoy and good at stats and maths side of it Hi Ken at the boxplots of the price and odometer look the same after removing the outliers I am quite confused Could you explain a little further Thanks Ken Jee is it okay to dive directly into coding and then googling one by one to the understand the usage and the math behind the algorithm Can you share the same for Machine Learning in Python and R I think you are good looking you're in it for the Money you don't like Autonomy you're uncomfortable with colaboration THANKS ME LATER My goal is to get in silver section at some Kaggle text mining competition this summer I think it will be a nice part of my resume hey Ken i'm currently working in finance and I wish to make a career change into data science analytics I've been told my some friends to complete some Datacamp courses and then to get a Tableau Power Bi certificate so that it'll allow me to get a job in the area How do you think i should go about this transition FYI i don't have a coding background so will be learning from scratch cheers Hey Ken I'd love to pursue a career in sporting analytics but specifically for tennis since it is my overwhelming passion Can you speak on how to break into the sporting analytics career for sports that don't have as big of a presence as basketball football baseball I appreciate your time congrats ken hy I need some help in my project about Elasticsearch can you help me Ps I like the Vedio Hey Ken enjoyed your vlog I am looking into vlogging myself just curious it looks like you are reading a tele prompter is that the case Hey Ken I am majoring in B S Information Sciences and a possible minor in computer science I also plan on getting a masters in Data Science Can I get data science internships with this major Is this a good pathway to get a data science major I Such a helpful video So glad I could find it Can you review my Portfolio I have only projects https www youtube com user rodfloripa New subscriber Ken what to do when robots txt show's disallow should you proceed Cause if you show this to a hiring manager he might take it as a red flag for ethics I want to scrap data from real estate provider's but the robots txt is disallowing every field how do I go about with end to end considering that web scraping is the first part of end to end Github Please of all your project's that got you a job I wanted to make a data science portofolio can you give me project ideas on how to approach it I am not getting ideas as to how to go about making an end to end machine learning project I m working on my PhD and taking a Data Science course My head is about to explode Great video Ken I will surely implement these tips Hi Hope you are doing gud I am an MBA in Finance Mgmnt nd having yrs of exp Pls suggest what shud I do to get into data science field Thnx I am relieved now I went about writing commands and tried memorizing them and that didnt work seems I am not the only one to be looking through stackoverflow during the entire project im working on Thanks for you advice Hello sir I know this question is coming out from no where but I feel you are the right person to ask the question so I'm asking how to select best 'Categorical features' in classification problem is there any way to find which categorical feature is contributing more in terms of predicting Thanks for the video Hey Ken Thanks for the video really appreciate this effort as you are taking your time in helping people in growing up their ladder I have gone through Kaggle and I find it pretty useful However I have a query do we need to have knowledge of BigQuery or Oracle SQL is enough Didn't know that Kaggle provides courses I'm now into it and the tutorials are clear and fun for a beginner I'm so glad I clicked your video on the recommendations Great stuff Ken Even though I'm an R guy i still find these types of videos very valuable It's great to see the actual thought process and methodology Reminds me of gameplay videos lol Thank you for the content I am right at this stage Thanks this series was really useful to see what goes into a good project from beginning to end I loved the honesty and openness including how you showed the debugging process and where you copied code from online whenever you got stuck on something Thank you I wanna be a good java and C programmer for a good foundation It is possible freelance on data analysis and data science This channel is going to blow up I got the same Salary Estimate values from start to end I don't know why and it's really a pain in the ass I rarely like videos theses But for this Hey ken Can sigma six green or yellow belt courses on Coursera would be useful for career advancement in data science I'm new to the channel and I subscribed after watching a couple of your videos great resources and advice its just what I was looking for I have a few questions about this video tho howcome theres nothing about statistics in the courses you've recommended I thiought its integral to data science and machine learning and if so what other prerequisites do I need Hey Ken great video as always Just a small question im currently an industrial engineering student so i have a good background in statistics and have enrolled in the EDX IBM data science certificate program I have finished all the courses excpet for the SQL one which i will start soon and feel like im fine with the coding and concepts regressions clustering classification etc but do not know where to go from here since i have only worked on project the capstone from the course As a next step i am thinking of learning tableau for data visualization and SQL but apart from that what do you suggest i do Thanks which keyboard are u using dude just make good videos don't beg or ask anyone to follow you It looks cheap If you have quality content people will definately follow you If you are putting out something good we want you to earn So no begging for following btw am following I really like this idea Please do more of these Maybe I'll send my resume too once I am done with my projects D Wow Quarintine has made go for Data science from SAP which I am currently working on Corporate job I already started with DS Math skills to just revise what Maths I did during Engg I also started with Python everything from scratch was making it difficult I watched one of your videos Best free courses in DS That has inspired me to go with what you have shared Thank you for sharing your knowledge Looking forward to more videos This was really helpful Thank you Handsome Ken Good stuff man I'm interning as a Data Engineer this summer and was also one last summer i actually really enjoyed it Mainly focused on ETL's and automation using Python and AWS Do you have any tips on resources where I can better my SQL knowledge Hi Ken I binged thru your videos I'm very new to this world although I've been in analytics for years I want to give the next step I just finished a basic python presential course and I'm currently enrolled in a presential course to get a basic data science diploma a I have no programming foundations so I'm doing basic programing course videos in YouTube trying to get the best foundations thru free and low cost courses since I can't afford going to college at this moment Is there any basic statistics course you would recommend to give me more idea about the analytics I appreciate that you share your experience with us Subscribed Many of the data scientists in the industry only use packages that they do not know the math behind or they do not understand the business question that they should solve I just admitted my offer in Data Science Undergrad I really like the video As always nice content and selfless guidance to enable more and more people in their skill set Thanks Ken Hi Ken I wanted to ask you as you are sports data Scientist that you could help me to start a career in esports data Scientist Like what are the requirements Skills and experience I am a gaming freak and I want to start a career in data science Thank you for this Ken Quick question what is that Mathematics book on your desk Very informative I recently became interested in data science and I'm trying to find out what my best course of action would be My biggest issue is that I don't have any computer science exposure I was a biology pre med major and I've been working in the pharmaceutical field for years I have a decent grip on statistical methods but again no knowledge of coding outside of excel and a few lines in R I'm afraid I'd be blown out of the water if I jumped into a master's program right away assuming I could get into one I guess my question is where do you think I should start Do data scientist have to know as much programming as actual programmers It takes how much time to become a data scientist Hey Ken I'm actually building my data portfolio but I'm a little lost on what to show I've done a lot of work with R and python projects analyzing data but I'm not sure if I should show every work project that I've done over the last years What do you recommend Thanks Ken Just starting out great post The IBM Data Science specialization course at Coursera com is a very good course for beginners I know it isn't free but anyone can get it for free by applying for financial aid at Coursera You made my day Sir Your video is quite informative and interesting I would ask you what would you recommend for a freshman economics student to do right now to be a competent data scientist I am almost done with all the basic things in R so far You learned data science in years Studying how much hours each day hi I am y o I hope I'm not to late to learn data science Hey Ken I've been following your channel for a couple weeks now and really appreciate the time you put into making these videos I graduated college a couple years ago with a degree in journalism and I find the integration of storytelling with data science very compelling Compelling enough for me to consider going back to school to get another degree in computer science as I would really like to combine the power of data science and journalism Thanks so much and keep it up Duncan Montr al Geez this is really good I really appreciate your content Ken I have a question and will appreciate an answer from anyone My background is in Petroleum Engineering and want to switch towards Data Scientist there is an online boot camp of months from brainstation cad to help me become a data scientist Do you think it's worth it Once you are a Data Scientist is it easy to transit to data engineer Great video thanks for explain it so simple Thanks for this video I reminded me of this book Making sense of Data by Glenn J Myatt and Wayne P Johnson It's focused mostly on the first four parts from what I saw What are your thoughts on engineers chemical transitioning to a career in CompSci specifically in Data Science What advice would give to for someone interested in data science but is currently pursuing a cs degree hey you said before you work with is there an affliction code for me to use Hey Ken I am currently pursuing civil engineering Final year and planning to do masters in data science So what advice can you give me before going for it I literally was searching for this kinda advice a few days back and so happy I found this video Thanks for the advice and insights Finally YouTube algorithm got me to the right channel I found the videos to be informative and thanks for sharing all these valuable links man Kuddos You are amazing to just listen and watch And hey I m the Office fan as well Thanks for clarification Thank you for the break of each role Now I know what to expect when I apply for internships in the Data Field later down the road ' Really good and clear eplanation Love your channel man I'm gonna try these out I am currently taking a Data science cousre and I'm at regression suggest something for me to sharpen my skills Scott young Do I need to learn Data Collection cleaning and EDA before moving to build ML models Or can I directly start with ML and build models The moment i learn about Data Science i knew i have found where to put my focus on but i still haven't been able to make a goal in that direction any tips My goal is to push my project to a stage of self sufficiency Data Intake Processing Consistent and manageable output Able to run forever till the code deprecates So like years if I'm incredibly lucky Thanks Keen for clear descriptions Looking for more useful videos further What would you say the difference is between data scientist and machine learning engineer hey I sent you an email requesting to have my resume reviewed thanks Currently a CS student looking at the data science field I'm in my school's co op program and also planning on doing its accelerated Master in machine learning as well I wonder if you have any take on getting a Master at a small and not as well known college Right now I'm finishing my sophomore year and my first internship but I'm finding it increasingly hard to even get a response from data science related roles I'm worried that this will be a snapshot of what's to come even when I graduate do you think a Master will help with getting past the initial resume screening or is it not worth it if it's not from a more recognized school Also really appreciate the fact you are still taking time to answer questions on old videos What's the difference between someone with a masters or PHD in Math who is a data scientist and someone that doesn't have a math background and is calling themselves a Data Scientist because of their experience in the field and some of the classes they have taken in data science Nicely broken down As someone who just landed in this industry it was very interesting Like the visualizations and the new style as well Thank you again for this video Ken We can say that I already work as a data analyst however my tools are restricted to BI and excel It turns out that I have the business core lacking programming and math skills Your videos have been helping me to create a plan in this process to become a data cientist thank again bro Which statistics book would you recommend for data Science k subscribers You are really blowing up Not long ago you were under k then k then wow It's great to see you are growing Keep up the great content Great explanation Hello thanks for your videos Actually I'm doing intership I'm data science but because of i m quarantined I should do self effort at home My question is all the time I try to watch videos and practice with it And I did online course but still I feel it's not enough which is true my knowledge not enough to bo data scientist So what you can advice me to BTW I will graduate in July for that I'm worry about my knowledge and capacity to look for job Thanks Wow This video was definitely an up in production It is really awesome to see you smile when you discuss your favourite topics in DS or f e when you did the intro it really shows that you're passionate about what you do and you enjoy making videos The nice graphics were a great addition to your video especially since they really fit well with a topic like this one showing what role is located where in the project lifecycle I'm excited to se what you come up with next D Hi Ken thanks for making this video I found this very helpful I have a question As I am in my senior year of computer science student I am not sure whether I should go further into master Especially when I look up the job openings all data scientists are usually required to hold at least a master degree Is it necessary for a data scientist or relatable positions as you mentioned in this video to have a master or even Ph D in Data Science field Thanks and please keep continuing to make this kind of video Fly high G This is perfect timing for me I just graduated and I'm starting to apply for full time positions Thank you Ken because of your video im into Data Science world currently I work as a Data Analyst for about months now I still find it hard sometimes to learn Data Engineer and DS part Is it better for me to learn DS part or DE part first thank you Your video help me so much Thank you Nice content friend I am starting a MS Statistics this month I know that many people choose to not get a degree to start a career in data analysis and data science but I think having the degree will help me land a better job starting out since many positions I have seen have a masters as the minimum qualification Also because of the job market right now I don't expect to start working till January of Your thoughts on this Great content Ken Do you know ir there s any DA or DS internship on FANG companies I could only found a research intern position and I m not sure it is trully related to DS I would really appreciate if you could put out your advanced portfolio tutorial video soon Thanks a lot Great info I'm definitely in the starting as a data analyst and progressing to be a data scientist boat Between EDA and model building where would you include feature engineering feature selection model validation I ask because I have sadly seen MLE job postings where there is zero modeling work I often find myself in this very situation at my current job where I merely productionize models created by more senior data scientists So yea I wonder how you think about the different interpretations of these roles in the industry Awesome break down I noticed that a majority of my time I spend on projects or learning is just cleaning data and exploratory analysis Hi Ken I m quite shy to tell this to you because this is off topic But it will be appreciated if you check out some of my cover songs on my channel And great content as always Great video I'm trying to start out as a data analyst as well Me causally watching Stefan Mischook video with Will Smith in the background Ken Jee comes up with a question Short and sweet You should try notion to track uour goals and for productivity it's great Have you Japanese roots Your name surname kanji XD Dear sir I'm from Electronics background and I want to be Data Scientist so I'm going for Masters of Data science please suggest were to start from so I can have great knowledge about Data science and be a good Data Scientist Another great video as always Thanks Really clear description Until now i have found the model deployment step really tiring and complex Is it necessary to master if i want to become a ML Engineer Another great video You can study Data Science and Artificial Intelligence in my university as a Bachelor and Master would you consider that a valid option as Artificial Intelligence seems to be more needed for someone with a PhD would you therefore recommend starting with studying raw Data Science Data Engineering or even Machine Learning for a Master Kind regards You're my Data Science mentor I hope to become a data scientist just like u I really like the fact that the description is basically a transcript Sometimes you just can't watch the entire thing and it really helps This definitely cuts into Ken's watch time awesome selflessness mate Thank you Love your videos Keep up the good work Thanks for watching everyone Definitely check out the data professor's channel as well More great visuals of his can be located here https github com dataprofessor infographic blob master Different Data Science Roles Explained JPG Great video Ken I like how you focused on the findings and not just the model It's something that people don't talk about but we need to give it more focus Keep up the great work Which micro courses on Kaggle should I take and in which order ARE you wearing an Oura ring fantastic channel man one of the best I've found you give practical examples more general concepts as well as mindset and tons of resources awesome man thank you Hi Ken is it possible for you to create a separate short tutorial on GIT Or can you guide on resource related to it Can't thank you enough Great series sir But I just wanted to ask what is the difference between using stats model LinrearRegression as I was usually using LinrearRegression to train model so not getting the difference That was truly creative The analogy was simple to follow and relate to Thanks for sharing Hello Just wanted to throw this out there I am with a degree in Finance and a real passion for technology programming I was a comp sci major in community college but didn't give it the time it needed and eventually switched to finance I quickly realized that I wanted to do something that I was passionate about which is numbers and programming I found data science So far on my journey I have acquired a Certificate in Data Science from UCI very high level stuff didn't really go into great depths mostly theory but I always have these doubts that I am too old to get into tech or that I don't have enough real world experience to get into tech I work hard everyday after work to learn more and more about data science Any advice words of wisdom from anybody that has had a similar path as mine Is it possible to see the data frame as you are in the top right corner similar to how it's presented in R in PyCharm or is this view specific to your IDE This is very inspirational man And I like the background elevator music too Thanks man i was searching for a vid like this Dude this whole series is awesome Thank you thank you thank you Can A person from commerce background with programming background can get to be data scientist And how Thank you for sharing all these awesome information I think the content of what you're saying is good but the video could be alot better It's like having a presentation with no slides it can still work but it's harder to follow as a listener I am a great cook Can I clear Data science interviews Is masters necessary to get a sports analytics job I like that this is not an overly technical video and drew me in to DS instead of being scary with loads of terminology If I could like this video twice i'd do that Thanks Thanks a lot it's really motivating Dropping https ocw mit edu courses electrical engineering and computer science machine learning fall probably one of the best foundational ML courses I've seen that's completely free and with a proper amount of depth The best part was the fool proof definition of linear regression Commenting to tell you tube algorithms that your videos are great Hey i just want to ask is data science has a strong relation with accounting Because i am kinda afraid that i learnt data science but it can't be implemented in accounting and my investment kinda ruined I think I may have just discovered the most useful YouTube channel ever good review I think this shows once again that documentation is really crucial In the end it does not matter how many incredible projects someone made if they can't showcase and explain them clearly even if this sounds harsh This really motivates me to improve my own resume I'm working on it but because I'm from Germany I actually have to translate my homepage so that I can send it out to international recruiters if needed and that takes up some time as well D I think your advice really is valuable even to people outside the US even though of course the formalities may differ f e in Europe it is much more common or even expected to include a personal photo on the resume but I think that the essence of interviews and what recruiters look for is generally the same across the countries especially for larger companies like FANG etc I think the interview process does not differ much For smaller companies though there can of course be differences Master's in astrophysics here I'm planning to complete two Coursera certificates in Deep Learning by Andrew Ng and Data Science IBM I have also taken courses in databases and data mining as part of my master's Hopefully I can get some job responses soon Hey Jee Can you suggest me as a beginner what should I first start basic stats or learn prog Lang Does it still make sense to learn python for data science Pycaret just came out few weeks ago and now you can do the same work much faster currently I'm learning randomly try to catch up with what I don't understand when reading the source code Q I have been doing data and investigative analytics at my company for the last years predictive modeling quarterly reviews etc I use software like Tableau and Excel I have an AA in BA I was planning on finishing my bachelor s in MIS and then a masters either MBA or MSBA Is this wise Any recommendations on certificates Is the Salesforce Admin cert good Thanks Excellent video I hope could followe your advice and the track you propose BTW great desk Hello from Brazil i loved your video i'm trying to use ML Neural network and random forest in human body signals I want to develop a project that can predict which muscle in shoulder needs a surgery Thank you so much for posting I am learning so much especially what I don't know and need to learn for my current data project I'm changing my career to be a data scientist well aiming for data analyst for now and I'll build up more skills to transfer to data science It's quite exciting That is not data science Great and informative series Keep it up My goal is to discover Data Science By now I am a chemist and I don't know how it could be useful for chemistry project but I am sure there could be a link Thanks for your videos it's super cool Hi i am so frustated i cant import my module in my spyder how i can get it Finally a video worth watching for Keep spam my feed please Great Series Ken Very informative and easy to comprehend from a novices perspective One question I do have and forgive me if I am not understanding this project correctly but how do we use this tool practically We are able to scrap the listings from glass door and ultimately make a model to estimate an avg salary for a job but when it is all finished is this a tool where we can plug in a job title and a set of skills or something and it returns an average estimated salary for said job for maybe salary negotiations of a current position etc Sorry if this went over my head when going over the project Keep up the good work and I will continue to follow along Sean Thank you a lot Ken You are motivating me as an undergraduate student studying towards this field but as you said I am in my second year still building our foundation on mathematics and statistics especially the topics you have mentioned in other videos Question Is django used in the field of data science if yes have you used it in any projects Hey ken this was an amazing video I'm just starting with DS and this helped a lot I also sent a mail to you can you please check that Thanks for all the great videos too keep it up I should learn a lot for creating my own model do you prefer spyder rather than pycharm Hey Ken really appreciate your effort I am facing a problem though Since i am an Indian user the website is being redirected to Indian version of the web page and Indian version lacks salary on top where company name position and location is mentioned What can i do to solve this p s Also while redirecting it gives an option to undo it but as soon as undo it the scrapping process gets terminated with an error KeyboardInterrupt Thank you for the useful video I run the codes a number of times just for checking I do successfully get the tweets but sometimes it returns with different numbers of tweets Do you know why is that the case and how to resolve it I did not set any limit for querry tweets The actual advice starts at Hi Ken I love your videos they've been incredibly helpful I'm an economics major with an actuarial science minor and am teaching myself Python and SQL through DataCamp right now I already have a fair amount of experience with R I am also doing a data science internship this summer I know this may make it seem like I am pretty set but I am also graduating this fall and am pretty scared about my job prospects Do you have any advice for more I could be doing to try to get into the field What is your opinion about Deep Learning Specialization course on Coursera Would it really help a lot to learn deep learning Would you do a Document of your experience of how to star Great advice Thank you very much Ken You re literally so cool I strive to be like you thanks for the info I noticed the trackball on your desk what trackball are you using I don't usually comment on youtube videos but this series is simply amazing It's often difficult to find content on data cleaning and model production so this project series will benefit me a ton Quick question what is the best way to go about modifying the scraper so that it can scrape a much larger dataset i e or data points I'm just developing an excitement for data analytics from a background in environmental science Loving your videos bonus Pretty cool Video O O Thanx a ton It seems my web scraper isn't scrolling down to access new postings It will successfully scrape the first handful up to and then spit out this error ElementNotInteractableException element not interactable element has zero size The error appears to be coming from line job button click Does anyone know how to deal with this I am new to web scraping Thanks Ken Jee Been Following you since you had views on each video I am SOOOOOO glad you are killing it I already saw it coming Thanks Ken Looking forward to the advanced video You can copy the entire code from Jupiter Notebook by clicking holding and scrolling Nice one Ken Thanks for keeping it simple Thank you so much for coming up with this video This is definitely impactful My first video of this channel and hi from your subscriber Hi I have a B S in Mechanical Engineering I've been out of college for about years now and have recently made the decision to switch to Data Science I have a decent level of programming experience from my time in college work with Matlab and C And I'm trying to figure out what the best path to this would be for me I'm not really in a position to stop working but my company will pay for me to go back to school up to k per year for graduate programs or k per year for certifications Over the past month I've been utilizing as many online free resources to learn as possible including kaggle LinkedIn learning etc What would you recommend is the best move for someone in my position Do you think after I build a few projects I could start applying to entry level Data analyst positions So I did small examples while learning this material during my MBA but didn't have the time to delve deeper into projects What sort of data science projects would you recommend for an MBA to learn Hi thanks for the video I was really looking for this kind of answers Although I already signed in the data science course in Udemy before watching this Just I have a question that terrifies me Do I need to be a math wizard Just the word algorithm terrifies me I always struggle with numbers even now I miss the most common and simple operations I'm doing a statistics course in Khan Academy to catch up as fast as I can But still freak out about it What can you suggest Not to panic Or focus myself inf hard core maths statistics algebra Hope you can answer beautiful video ken Hi Ken I started web scraping and made necessary changes to retrieve estimate salary as Described in the video but I failed By the way you have inspired a lot to me man thank you so much Keep posting great content very excited for upcoming content how can I get all comments from one tweet Hi Ken wanted to ask you about how can you use analytics for soccer as data there is more unorganised like how to identify the patterns of play various formations used during the match using analytics and by the way love you videos Without real world experience you won't have any credibility Develop a feel for the data what's valid what's not identify insights patterns that jump out at you Then develop a story to convince your stakeholders Use their language Hi Ken You became my one of the mentors Thanks for the resources And I request Could you do video Data preprocessing vs EDA Like what should come under which Hope you will Great Video Question I watched andrew ng machine learning course on coursera but he taught everything on Octave I know basic things about machine learning but nothing about phython Could you recommend me a course just for python for machine learning Get well soon This series is exactly what I wanted and I highly recommend to anyone who is entering in Data Science This is really helpful Ken Please do more of these Ken thank you for your content I participated in Stanford's week course titled Code in Place and we're now in our final project phase We spent the past five weeks learning Python I found your videos through searching data science for beginners what is data science in efforts of getting ideas for what kind of final project I want to try The week pace of the course was absolutely too fast for me but I am so glad I found your channel After this video in particular this is definitely a path I want to continue learning about ie what new information can I read by using methods beyond my usual qualitative analysis approach to things and you've already helped me create a learning path beyond this course Thank you I look forward to more content Hey Ken I appreciate that you put a small summary in the description This really is great stuff Ken Out of curiosity Why don't you have a patreon page or something You content is so valuable to aspiring data scientists I'm sure people would want to support you This video was a good summary of things I dont know lol My journey seems to have lenghtened Thanks I paused the video and read your wall posts and it was amazing Your channel looks pretty amazing too I was wondering what capstone projects to work on and I think I'll find an answer within your material Great job Hey Ken I don't know you but the algorithm recommended this vid I think it is better if you start off with describing a bit about who you are otherwise I don't think the title itself can really grab people's attention because you haven't established validity Maybe just something to think about for future vids Hey Ken great videos I am a relative newbie and up until know I have been following along smoothly with no errors however with the step of running the wsgi py file and running then curl X etc in the command line I am getting the same error you were however the your fix did not work for me time stamp and I made sure to copy the code you had to the letter Following Error DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC W C DTD HTML Final EN title Internal Server Error title h Internal Server Error h p The server encountered an internal error and was unable to complete your request Either the server is overloaded or there is an error in the application p Any ideas Sean I have become very confused with the different advice various people give regarding data science The coding languages like R and python seem to give the user a more technical and intricate level of work but these don't seem inviting to me when there are options like Matlab available which is significantly more user friendly especially for beginners I graduated with an engineering degree last year I have since tried to study machine learning with python after having no background in the language and it seemed more difficult to study and memorize all the different algorithms one has to go and create or the the different uses of packages like numpy On the other hand I started a course on data science with MATLAB and the ease of graphing and using visual aids seemed to make Matlab a more desirable choice for me That being said I don't really hear of Matlab being a buzz word in the data science community why is this Where would Matlab be more applicable than software languages like python or R Thanks very much really helpful I think my goal right now is to figure out what my goal is Hi Thanks for the cool video Can you please confirm do we need any developer account in order to get past month tweets Also i want to extract tweets from specific location is it possible Further please confirm if we can specify hashtags and keyword based search with this method What keyboard is that This is supper awesome Keep going brother I will keep following you Cool content My first time on this Series and I think I will love it Hello Ken Regarding the applicability of your advices outside the US I can speak about Brazil my home country and France the country I currently live Basically everything you said so far applies equally to both places specially regarding the number of pages in the CV I've been working with engineering for some time now and in Brazil I see a certain tendency of giving more importance to soft skills than to technical skills at least in my area The idea is that you can teach somebody how to program for example but it's really hard to teach someone how to have be a good team player Watching youtube videos about data science I have the impression that on the US the job interviews focus a lot on asking technical questions but I'm not sure if it's the same through all types of jobs Very intuitive Thanks I've a Master degree in Physics specialization particle physics I'm thinking of diving into data science So apart from what you have said would you be able to guide me in this regard specifically What would be the best case scenario in my case I have a strong background of Mathematics and an intermediate level of programming Are Edx Courses Worth And their certification Hi Good video Would you argue you need a strong programming background to become good at this I have a MBA with a lot of statistics and planning to change paths to Data science I do have some experience with Python Would this be a good base change careers Thanks for the useful recommendations Ken I am looking to buy a new laptop for my msc in data science I have my current for years and it isn't in good condition Do you have any recommendations or some specs that I should focus on Hi Ken Good review Can you help us know what are the books available online on data science I learn better when I read Which language according to you is more beneficial to learn for Data Science Ken R or Python Currently I'm taking Data Science using R So should I focus on Python as well And can you please suggest some good courses Thank You Great video Helps me with my own projects Can you make a video on connecting your own data Thank you so much for sharing this ken Im really loving your videos Thanks Ken for another quality video Great insights from the recruiter's point of view Thank you for your valuable advice Very good summary of what should assist those on this path Well done Ken Thanks for making this video Ken Really inspiring me to keep learning data science Thanks for watching everyone If you would like to have your project reviewed please comment below and send an email with your info to kenjee ds gmail com For more resume and project portfolio advice please check out this playlist https www youtube com watch v DM eE Coh g list PL zq klxX ARnFpk JauioZb zyxNZek Great recommendations Would love if you reviewed my project too Lovely content Ken Keep them coming Eagerly looking forward to your extended video on How to make a Github portfolio Thanks Great video Also you should make a video about how to style your hair too D It has inspired me a lot I really recommend this video https techiesphere co data science career in data science how to build as a fresher Hi Iam working as devloper using java springboot I would like to switch my carrier into data science In what order I can learn DS I am a commerce graduate and want to pursue my career in data science but i am not sure if commerce educational background will help me Do i necessarily need to have a technical educational background to pursue my career in this field please help and answer I was using the jupyter notebook on Mozilla and I m getting the driver error again and again I tried to fix it but it shows unicodeescape error please Ken off of on your videos are very helpful This is so helpful I'm really new to Data Science field I'm working as an intern data scientist I don't really have much work at office which is really frustrating I'm applying to many companies but I'm not able to get into any Can someone tell me what am I don't wrong Hello how non tech candidate can move in that Bcz he don't have how to start Plz make vedio on that Great tutorials Have you considered trying streamlit for publishing the app Now I know I am at stage I need to practice and learn simultaneously Thanks Ken Hi Ken I do recall when I couldn't find any guidance about how to initiate a DS project and what all steps needs to be carried for a complete DS project with git hub repo your DS project from scratch proved a life saviour for me I loved that series so much that I completed that in a single stretch Thank you so much for making DS videos and helping us to understand the concepts behind it I can say that you are a North star for aspiring Data Science professional like me Wish you to cross million subscribers shortly Thanks Vinay Would you recommend doing the deep learning courses by deeplearning ai on Coursera Really would like to know your thoughts Hi Ken opinion on Government Data science jobs I can say u r going to be one of the famous educational youtuber channel the content is genuine and is very well made i am beginner I'll follow ur footsteps Curious where'd you get those glasses lol To be a good data scientist do we need to be good at pure math A lot of software engineering is logic based is it different for DS There is no shame to be DS for make more money When I will make money i will love what I do On the lucrative side does coming in with a Master's Degree boost your potential pay cut Thanks for a really informative helpful video Very helpful topic thank you Hi Ken thank you very much for this video Very informative I've been exploring data science for a few years now and I believe I have all the skills necessary R Python SQL PowerBI statistics I would love to get into the sports analytics field professionally but I haven't found the right channels to do that yet I'm also in the Chicago area so I was wondering if you have any specific tips to network with people in the sports analytics field In your experience what are some of the interesting organizations in the IL area and how would you recommend approaching hiring decision makers Hey Ken have you thought about creating an intensive comprehensive course in Data Science Lots of courses just teach the concepts but not real world varied applications with different dirty and challenging datasets Project Management Ken Very cool analysis I wonder if you could get the data on strikeouts I remember seeing some discussion that the Astros' team strikeout was significantly lower than the MLB average If that is the case then that would give them an advantage in a number of ways strikeouts are a key metric for pitchers especially in high leverage late game situations Really looking forward to part two Baseball analytics is a particular favorite of mine Hi thanks for your video I wish there were English subtitles for non native like me Hi Ken would you choose studying master in Statistics or Data Science If you had to start over I really like Github Pages and I've used it to setup my own personal website as well The great thing is that you can also just buy a cheap domain and let it redirect to your Github Page so you do not even need to buy a certificate to enable HTTPS It really is just the flatout easiest way to build a good looking personal portfolio ahh you upload so many great videos so quickly I can't keep up with commenting D I'll stick to it though because I really want to support your channel As I've said multiple times already you are really a great inspiration to me and I genuinely enjoy watching your videos I just saw your video on DS's channel and I must say that was really great D Your expertise combined with the very flavorful animation style of was really fun to watch It's just incredibly how you tripled your audience in a matter of days all the best wishes to you I guess you would be The Data Lead I just found your channel and I'm planning on watching one of your videos every single day starting today Great content thankful that it's useful and informative instead of mindlessly entertaining like so much of youtube Hi thanks for sharing this insight m well settled and have a career in security industry but I want to learn about data analysis so that I can make sense of numbers and improve like u did with golf awaiting ur response thanks I'm hoping to see similar improvements in data science as you've had in YouTube Keep up the great work How'd u rate datacamp's Data Science with Python track If I only take the data science certificate I E like the IBM professional certificate would that be adequate enough I have just graduated in Petroleum Engineering where have learned conceptually and mathematically the Oil and gas industry particularly on the upstream sector hance I understand the basics underlying the Energy business Best advice from a data scientist nothing is what it seems If you have yet to enter the data science and analyst field still in school or studying what you think a data scientist is day to day is wrong So keep an open mind We re not writing algorithms on the windows of dorm rooms Hint of our work is research and data preparation cleaning If you want to be a kick ass data scientist learn how to interview data users Coding is the easy part did I say be open minded Good Now tell yourself over and over and over almost no companies know what data science is And neither do you So let me tell you what data science is it s the ability to understand and manipulate data and or information That s it Data science is not Python If I give you an excel sheet of data and ask you to create a pivot that shows me counts and sums of those counts and you do that you are being a data scientist Your ability to code in a certain language does not data science I m telling you this cause being and looking this internet conceived data scientist part person is a misconception and can kill your dream of ever growing into a great data scientist Give yourself credit for what you know And be confident that because you can analyze data in excel you can also learn object oriented programming nothing is what it seems Just cause a job title doesn t say data scientist doesn t mean your not going to do data science work I m a business intelligence developer I manage data from Oracle SQL Server and Cloud data lakes When I sit down at my desk I open Dbeaver SQL Server Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook All these IDE s get used daily That means I coding in languages at a minimum daily ONLY ONE of those languages is Python My job title is NOT data scientist My point in all my rubbish talk is that data science is a lot like the cloud Over years ago the cloud concept became the rage And yet most companies are still struggling to implement or even leverage the cloud Data science is sadly going down that path too Most companies and their managers are posting jobs to hire data scientists and as long as the job posting has a requirement of must know Python it s a data scientist job posting However of the managers hiring data scientist don t know what a data scientist is themselves And those managers couldn t tell you what a Jupyter notebook is Or how to write print hello world in Python Yet they re interviewing candidates for Python development If and when you enter the so called data scientist career path be open minded This is a journey not a goal Enjoy the trip Be flexible Knowledge trumps job titles If you want to get paid the big bucks be the most valuable player That means work on everything sent your way And show off your skills Good luck Do you just make videos on how to learn datascience noting some courses and website here and there I've been interested in getting into sports analytics would i be able to do it if i do sports science at university bro your video is extremely helpful and very practical about data science i got really motivated again in data science keep up ur work really appreciate your work thanks Thank you so much for this KJ Thanks for video What course should a student enrol for degree program that will create job opportunity in data science field Should I go for degree in data science or degree in computer engineering Thanks Thank you for uploading videos and help us to develop new skills Going through the book which you mentioned in the video ultralearning Will re watch the video once I complete the book Hey ken Great work and a eye opener A tennis coach in Mumbai India Am total begginer into this what would you recommend how do I start with I have no IT background or any tech background But I believe the data analyst in tennis would work wonders to get know detailed side of the game Thanks Hello Ken Is there any that we can connect through WhatsApp I want to grab more knowledge techniques from you because YOU ARE THE BEST Please consider my request and I wont bug you with too many questions in case if we connect Subscribed I really like how informative your channel is without being preachy A lot of tech youtubers big themselves up to a point where you feel you're too late or too shit Your channel provides useful resources and info Thanks Thanks so much for putting this content out Currently a Data Analytics undergrad student after having done a Data Analytics bootcamp lol this video has been an invaluable resource I have a question regarding your second point of going back to grad school not wanting to go back to school and still wanting to work in data science Why do you consider Physics to be an integral part of learning in the field I can see why one should study 'CS Math Statistics or some other quantitative discipline' but hadn't thought of Physics and how it fits in the data science landscape Interested in your thoughts Thanks for your time Hi Ken what is your opinion of writing Unit test to make sure your data cleaning is done correctly It is hard to find a mistake when you have thousands of rows But you can find mistakes better if you data set is small and controlled Hi Ken I am making a career change and want to get a second degree in CS I noticed some schools do not offer second degrees except at the graduate level What were your other school choices for your MS degree How did you research Any good resources Did you consider online program Excellent work subscribed My question is Is this course is enough to get job in data science The text small and hard to see Wow ken this is awesome I have worked on or so projects so hopefully that's enough to land a job Didn't realize how quick you can create a portfolio like this Cheers Have to work on this when i finish my next project This is my first year as a data scientist student i will watch all your videos wish me good luck How much money do you make This is very interesting topic you should talk about Thank you for sharing your wisdom Ken Keep sharing Thanks Ken intro music is superb thanks Thank you for your videos Ken I saw your videos and looked up your LinkedIn profile as well It mentions your recent experience as a product owner Would it help to learn data science for future career interest in Product Ownership and Innovation Hi Ken thanks for the insight Im currently doing a full stack web developer course and after i finish i want to branch out to something different Data science maybe the option I have no background in computer science or maths Would u still think its achievable to accomplish or would it be too difficult of a task If you think it is achievable what math do u recommend i start learning Thank You Iam an electrical engineering graduate past out on and am interested in data science I do have programming knowledge in c c is any job experience is necessary for this to start learning You are growing very fast I was your k sub and you are k ahead already You deserve more Thanks for all your info This was really useful I m currently dual majoring in mathematics and computer science with a minor in actuarial science Would it be useful to go for a PhD in statistics or is that overkill for data science Ken I know i'm going a little off topic but still What's your opinion on the new MacBook as a main computer for a CS data science oriented undergrad Hello Ken I'm a new subscriber I love your channel I've been going through a few videos I'm currently working in the social impact sector I'd like to know more about how I can use data science to grow in my career I have no background in Data Science but I do have some understanding of the basics of programming I studied electrical engineering in my undergrad and have some experience with SQL through some previous jobs My current role is more operational which I enjoy but I would like to explore this area Could you share your thoughts on the intersection of these two fields Also would like to add after watching through this particular video I feel that a DS certificate DS bootcamp would not be the best fit for me been struggling to get into DS on and off years after i finished my masters in management science am even embarrassed and maybe a bit frustrated with myself a bit but u have given me the morale to get back on it been binge watching all your videos your route seems pretty legit and straight forward much gratitude man will watch the ads just for u Thank you Ken This video is great and will be helpful for me Hope to see you anytime soon I watched all previous videos but I just noticed a new intro haha but it looks really good I am on stage let's see how many of us Hello I've been trying to figure this exact thing out and I'm so glad this came by I am really inspired by everything that you have said The videos that you have made actually help me alot on the journey to become a data scientist Hey Ken your content is amazingly powerful and yet very simple I have always been looking for such information You have made it so much easier Thanks for imparting such knowledge for free Can I request you to also have a video on GitHub basics so that we can start from there Ken Man Really thank you for this video It was really a helpful one These are the kind of videos that we need as a lot of people are still trying to make sense of the field especially non techies Do continue the series with respect to where we can find quality data sets and how we can take one firm footed step at a time Im getting interested in programming and have a regular science degree with no background in mathematics The idea excites me but with no experience in maths its probably too bigger decision for myself maybe ill just stick to Spatial science we will see Thanks for the resources But i am bit confused which should i go for data science or deep learning Thanks for your help in advance We all know consulting is a fake career Great video Would you recommend to have some of these project on a resume for applying internship position not so much in the data field but more of a business position that required some levels of data analysis capabilities e g Market analyst business analyst project manager and such Big like Love the way he describes getting into this field I just want to say that you are doing a great job You are not BS and you are trying to say something useful and brief Kudos man you're great Is a bachelors degree in business analytics a good start in the field of data science if you re really bad at maths and know nothing about programming Great work Ken Jee sharing resources to help people meet their learning goals there is another free machine learning platform which is excellent very easy to use and easy to learn www eazyml com we tried it and I think eazyml is one of the most transparent ML platforms in the market their promise is Learn ML By doing ML Good luck I have statistics bachelor degree but I graduated years ago and I never worked on my major basically I don't know anything about it I'm really interested in Data science these days I started to learn Python last month how realistic to be data scientist in one year for someone starting from zero do you recommend any master about it or online courses might be enough Thank you I really like your videos please keep sharing with us Thanks a lot for this video What do you think of the job demand in And I'm also concerned about the paying is the income good in the data science career What salary can I expect it's beautiful how you are thankful for us but actually we are happier and more thankful for you truly you educated and inspired me and led me to great resources also thank you because your work is not just useful but also beautiful and well made can't wait to reach my th not bad project and th nice project and th amazing project and look back at the journey a journey full of learning and growing and amazing experiences You have wonderful content I've noticed that your subs have been growing pretty rapidly over the last days congrats With regards to Kaggle a professor once told me if a product is free you're the product How might this be the case with Kaggle Why is the platform free Thanks for your effort man I have certain use cases in mind for diabetology research would love to have a personal chat on how we can leverage data science for that Hello Ken I am a doctor involved in clinical research and i stumbled upon your channel while trying to understand how to handle large clinical datasets You are doing a great job of guiding us through data science Hi Ken we're you able to scrape the jobs in one shot because I kept getting an error of 'element click intercepted' after the script went through a few job posts And I googled the world and couldn't find what that error meant Thanks for your videos they're great Man you are best of the best My man is stoned Thank you for the great content Github Pages is free and easy to use It's perfect for portfolio and personal website I was building the page using some template from minimal mistakes that will help the layout even better But I think the project content matters the most At least for me I don't mind reading something interesting from a not very flashy representation Awesome stuff Really excited to see the advanced version D This is so cool You just got subscribed keep up the good work Awesome Ken Looking forward to the next one Delivered as promised Ken thanks again for as alway the Amazing videos Thank you was wondering how to do this New subscriber here watching your old videos when i take a break from doing the kaggle micro course as you advised in your more recent video Thanks a lot for the great advise That was really fascinating always thought I need to do a lot of work for building my portfolio Thanks Ken great job Saw your project on data science Every time you come up with something great Thanks Hey Ken Amazing video I'm sure your channel is going to grow a lot Very interesting and informative video Ken Thank you I was considering to make a few exploration notebooks For example a notebook trying to cover the difference between classification algorithms with some hyper parameters tuning and trying to figure out the best metrics to use This isn t exactly a very original project but I think it ll contribute a lot for my learning process Do you think this would be a good candidate to go for my portfolio Thanks again It's like you read my mind I was looking for this yesterday I really appreciate what you are doing I look forward to your future videos Amazing it saved so much tedious work and efforts Thanks for sharing looking forward to see the advanced version I never knew the github can do that Thank you ken for that Super helpful video as usual Ken I just happened to be starting a GitHub profile and doing my first project so this came at the perfect time Very straightforward Added to my to do list Excited to see the advanced version Hi great video I have a question I hope you can help me I am reading a few articles about this profession and I saw that the massive job opportunities require an IT graduate And massive knowledge of statistics how deep do I need to know about these skills I am yo a biologist I got a PhD but in environmental science I don t want to spend time and money if the market will exclude me damn needed this Learn To Program For Data Science Easy Great and concise video on getting a portfolio website up and running in no time Thank you sir Love from India Thank you so much u r the best Finally you made a video on this I had been searching for this for a while Eagerly waiting for the advance part If you have some time do check this out anurag ux

I just completed a course on inferential statistics great course but I don t know where and how to apply the knowledge I have gained Can you help me out please Sir i have couple of problems unrelated to this Video I am a rd year engineering student from India and planning to go ms in data science in USA after th year is ms in data science really worth it from current and future of industry persepectie like I am seeing that some people prefer years of industrial experience over years of masters but I really like ml and want to publish papers in this domain Now i have read couple of books on ml and DL but now i am confused whether a to start learning practical application of ML like I have build a model but what next To make my model more interactive and useful like I don't want to show companies my py file so to solve that problem maybe I should go for MLops devops ml or read more research papers learn new and advance algo and techniques which no books or course teaches u start doing competition and maybe go for writing a research paper which would be very helpful for my ms admission in good college Can u help like any advice would help a lot on what should my direction of working after gaining so much knowledge but have very little practical knowledge of impelnting Thanx and sorry for such long question Any suggestions for learning computer vision and Deeplearning Can we learn Ml and Ds parallel i am interested in both Also give suggestions to learn these feilds online I am a new subscriber On your milestone for th video Your video are really good related to data science I have watched a few videos today I really love it Thanks you for this really amazing video that helped me learn new concepts Today So glad I came across your channel this was a super helpful video Hello Ken Kindly let me know the best resources for learning DNN NLP and CV which will cover everything from basics to advance Thanks in advance There's not enough content in this video to fill even the seconds in the beginning when you ask everyone to subscribe Is it just me or YT is a time black hole Nice video Ken In the business of sharing This guy's stuff is good Not free but reasonable https machinelearningmastery com Keep up the good work Thank you for those valuable recommendations I've just placed an order for the one thing Side note the Weitzman institute is in Rehovot Israel not in Europe So basically I have covered all kinds of math for Data science great video Thanks Ken Thanks for sharing Ken First I would like to to thank you for your video it is very helpful and professionally delivered Second I am so pleased to know you and your channel Currently I am studying Data Science with computer science concentration and I am planning to obtain my graduate degree in big data can you please feed me back if that is a good option or should I consider other fields Thank you Helo sir is there any differrance between data science degree and data base mangement degree Great video man Where did you go to grad school My next goal is Kaggle grandmaster I majored in math in college and I studied multi var calc linear algebra probability discrete continuous and multi variable statistics numerical methods discrete optimization math of computer algorithms discrete mathematics Lots of other stuff that I doubt is relevant to data science Excellent Ken reminds me a lot of my own style while teaching tech concepts to non techies Thanks for all the helpful videos man I may be an Information Technology and Business student but nothing is going to stop me from exploring Data Science and slowly climbing my way up to be like you one day man I just completed an undergraduate degree in biomedical science and planning to do a Masters in data science and I was wondering how much of a transition would it be if I haven t done any coding or maths I basically followed and tried every step while watching the video It is very practical and useful to learn during job preparation One little thing is could you please zoom in the page a bit more next time especially edited in the dark IDE so that it is easier to watch and practice the code together Sorry is this is a dumb question but what are we exactly looking for when we look for trends Are there some common things that you look for as a data scientist or do you just really need to understand your data well and be creative to find some interesting things in your data Any resources you suggest for how to go about doing EDA as a beginner Damn boi you growing fast lol Congrats ken I have a question for you How to do feature selection on imbalanced data do we need to do with original data imbalanced or with oversampled data SMOTE Which is better Good content I do this all the time don't feel bad about myself any more thanks Can i learn data science through data science course on coursera I have just pass my high school Is data science still be useful and demanding in Congratulations Your videos have been very helpful and also what is your opinion about DataScience course Hey ken As a beginner should i learn the fundamentals of machine learning at first Because i know python then i jump to maths Do you have a hickey Great video thank you for sharing May I ask what route you took to becoming a data scientist Did you go to school and majored in something relevant or were you a self starter mathematician and learned coding by yourself I know it's a loaded question and off topic from the video but some info is very much appreciated thank you Can you point to some projects from kaggle that we should do in stage and stage Sir Your Content is great but it is not reachable to everyone who want this Thats why your channel has subscribers If you try to reach more and more people then million subscribers are not so far Congratulations There is not many informative channels out there and I'd say I'm lucky to find yours given that YouTube algorithm is not too friendly to smaller YouTubers Video Idea How do you analyze your own Youtube channel data Hi Ken thank you for the great video As a four year experience data risk analyst I think your suggestion makes a lot of sense A master degree could be a great choice if I want to move to a data scientist type of role I wonder if you could share your thought a little bit about a master in DS vs Stats My concern is DS programs are relatively new and maybe most hiring managers are suspicious about the program and expectation of candidates are not established yet so they would rather choose candidates with stats background And plus fundamental knowledge of stat could potential help solving hard core tasks in career later Could you please share your thought on this please Thanks Good stuff Sir i have couple of problems unrelated to this Video I am a rd year engineering student from India and planning to go ms in data science in USA after th year is ms in data science really worth it from current and future of

great Thank you so much But in the list are no replies How to collect replies to the same file Congratulations Ken Next stop K Subscribers Nice Thank you Hey great content I wonder about the market for data scientist now Do you think it's a good idea to go through bootcamps like Springboard I want AI focus is python and R what I should learn Hi Ken thank you very much for your help with your wonderful videos I am years old and have come this far through my fondness for the NBA and fantasy games I would like to go a little deeper through some courses that I am doing Mathletics Python R Sabermetrics Do you think it is a waste of time considering that my mathematical education is that of the institute Thanks again Truly helpful mate thanks Ken Jee what is this keyboard that you are using Is It better to learn machine learning in python because I learnt it in Octave Great VIDEO Hello I'm from Japan This video was fantastic My goal is to lead the Japanese DS world and make the world great In your opinion is a certified bootcamp a good way to go if available Thank you too Please don't be like other YouTubers who stop replying to most of the comments Viewers invest their valuable time on your videos for learning from you Therefore please try your level best to reply to all of their comments Take care and keep the good work Data science makes my head hurt I wish I ran into your video when I was still in school I literally graduated TODAY Can't seem to figure out how to query by twitter handle i want to learn data science hoping for a career change i've started doing programming more with python since and also some machine learning stuff but im very easily distracted and therefore unable to focus thanks for this video I used to Hate Lambda function but really I got good understanding from this Video Thank you so Much Hey Ken Congrats Today I was applying to data analyst roles and I remember you saying that these are great roles for people who want to pursue data science but aren't quite there yet I think you said that Anyway I was wondering if you had any tips on pursuing these roles And in honor of your subscriber and th video I just like to say that I took an online SQL course and somewhere I discovered your SQL Lahman's Baseball tutorial and it was great as a supplement That's how I found your channel Keep up the good work Great video dude I think this is a topic that most learners are interested in and you approached it very well all actionable information and no fluff Can you review my Github profile please I do not have a CS background that's why I don't feel confident yeah do the live streams The thing I really like about your video is the stress on getting stuck into projects I am a few months into learning about Machine Learning but it is only since I started focusing on actually doing projects that I actually feel like I am beginning to understand what is going on Before I was focusing on programming algebra statistics and I felt like I was just going through the motions but now that I started trying to do the projects its like I am waking up and finally learning Wish I had gotten stuck into projects much sooner Another Great Video Thanks man You forgot the step where you learn the basic concepts of data science and machine learning Basic statistics won't cover that and copying code you found on Kaggle without understanding why things are done that way is a good way to pick up some terrible habits Like not understanding overfitting for example Hey Ken thank you so much for this I am currently trying to transition from consulting to data science but have been really struggling to find ways to demonstrate my knowledge to potential employers This really helped Projects don't look like so daunting now Hi Ken how about a more detailed video on the different ways to assess the accuracy of the model Try to use the Raw button if there's one on top of the editor within the page where you want to get the code from This was insightful I am eager to begin the data science journey i would like to be mentored I am looking for someone willing to be my mentor Thanks for this wonderful project walk through You are my teacher now Cool man Just found your channel a few days ago and I think I have finally realized what route I want to take with my CS degree Thanks sincerely a computer science student Congrats Ken Keep crushing it In order to learn data science is it necessary to learn deep learning and ai Awesome tutorial simple and efficient thanks a lot Thank buddy It surely helps You're videos are so informative Great Ken Congratulations buddy You are going to reach K mark pretty soon I want to become more familiar with R this summer Hey ken if i do my bachelors in computer applications or economics can i become a data scientist and which one is gonna help me more Also is it important to get a data science degree or diploma Congrats Ken I m happy to be a part of this milestone your content is truly amazing and inspiring I m excited to see how much your channel will grow over the next couple of months keep up the great work Hi Ken I have a question for you I'm studying social sciences at the moment with a specialization in quantitative data analysis We're not just doing basic stuff I already did courses on geodata analysis network analysis even did an analysis of Twitter communities with data that I scraped with the Twitter rest API multilevel models structural equation models and causal analysis But we have no courses on machine learning actually there would have been a course this semester but it got dropped because of corona I guess it's too difficult to run a Zoom stream for a guy working with machine learning idk And we also didn't do much on efficient coding speeding up the code I'm mostly working with R What do you say would be a good next step to get deeper into data science with that pretty solid foundation of knowledge on statistics Can you recommend courses books or other sources for my situation All the data science sources that I found were starting from zero which was a bit annoying for me Thanks Hi everyone I am graduating from college this year with an economics degree I have about a year of experience working as a data analyst MySQL Stata R Python proficient Since startup recruiting has been a bit tricky because of the virus I want to use the next few months while I am unemployed and living at home to become more proficient in higher ML techniques I am interested in AGI how can I move forward if I choose path of data science is there any other path Hi ken i dont have a background in mathematics and statistics but i am a SAS programmer Can i become a data scientist Hey Ken Thanks for sharing this video amazing content Do you recommend Dataquest DS courses I am thinking of applying to its annual subscription since they offer different types of practical projects Hi I am from technical support background with years of experience Can I start learning data science now Does it helps to my carrier enhancement Is Computer hardware Instruction set architecture necessary before starting to learn Data science Thank you This channel has been a huge resource for me What are your thoughts on ML course by Andrew Ng on Coursera its the most famous out there and is completely free will it make people like YOU no smile at all not even a fake oh man Hello everyone it's Yeah right you probably heard it Awsome channel for data science keep it up This is just a start Your channel deserves much more Thank you for your advice and motivations Inspiring video your videos have helped so much Congrats Ken Cheers Your video on free data science resources helped me start my journey Still got a ways to go but your content has been very helpful to get me where I am now Ah I can still remember back to when I first found your channel I was doing a project that made use of Twitter data and I found your video on Twitter scraping It helped a lot and also introduced me to your awesome channel Congrats on the milestones I look forward to the future of this channel I wish I came across your channel earlier I wouldn't have wasted so much time finding the right resources amongst the overwhelming amount of resources out there for learning Data Science Great I observe after your DS project for beginners series no of subscribers increased day by day Best of luck ken We expect more than that from you Dude I subscribed like a few weeks ago when you had k subs Now you re at k Congrats my man I m so glad to have found your channel Congratulations Looking forward to all the future videos Congratulations I look forward to someday talking to you You inspired me as we both are from similar background economics I am about to start on this DS journey as I am wrapping up my PhD Thank you Congrats Ken pls upload projects for begineers Just found out about your channel your videos are really informative and I like your way of teaching c I hope you grow and do more videos I just started studying data science months ago and your videos really help me stay and keep motivated Thanks Also if it's okay that I ask about books I can read for the statistics and any great reads that you find really helpful This is such a nice channel Great job Ken you deserve it You make high quality content I just want one guidance Till now I completed learning python pandas Numpy Data visualization I didn't started learning any Machine learning algorithm As you always said Learn by doing Projects So with this knowledge can I start doing Projects Please clarify this Thank you Congrats Ken I m a recent grad in the job search I m glad to see this content Keeps me motivated and shows me areas to improve in Truly thank you Excellent work Ken really meaningful It is changing the live of many junior data scientists and improving our carrers and hence our lives Congratulations and keep inspiring data science community Can you please upload a playlist on retraining a deployed model and handling multiple user requests at once an extension to your deployment video would be heavenly Weldone Ken Your videos are very informative Congratulations Congrats on both quality content at its best hope you grow exponentially the best way to learn is thru teaching I really like these vids Good job Ken That was fast If I remember correctly you had k subscribers before weeks Road to k amazing Have you done any sport analytics videos Started from the bottom Now you are here Congrats man Congratulations Ken on this great milestone Really enjoyed watching your videos Thank you for bring great value to the Data Science community th viewer like Already subscribed Keep up Ken Congratulations You're amazing Ken Keep up the good work Again I am so grateful for everyone who has supported this channel I look forward to being a part of your data science journey going forward Congrats on k subs I remember watching your first project walkthrough video where one of your goals was k and you said you were so far off from that and now look at you Hey Ken all the mathematics stuff you mentioned was in the syllabus of our previous semesters but honestly I don't remember many of the things right now So should I go through all of those topics before enrolling for a course or just start right away It s great to be able to watch and listen to someone who s gone through what you re currently trying to get through I m also going to do a nd masters in Business Analytics starting in the Fall and I ve been trying to get a lot of practical experience via personal projects and some really good online resources from Coursera and Dataquest It s pretty cool to get reminded of the big picture like this and I look forward to watching the rest of your videos and new releases Thanks for the awesome content and for providing clarity to those in pursuit of their dreams Hi K thank you so much I have longing to learn data science the problem was where to start Your advices are on point At least now I know where to start Thank you Do well in my summer data science research project I have a background in Business and I am trying to understand Python but since I don't have the background in the technical side and I am finding it difficult Thanks for the information I think I am familiarizing myself with Python Ken could you also review some good data science resumees Ken Jen Thanks for this channel The content is awesome Please review my GitHub github com jalotra I was very interested in Machine learning and data Science I would like to see all your videos They may help me to achieve my goal Please do many videos that encourage and guide the beginners Thanks Thanks for the video very reassuring Please can you recommend any free statistics for data science courses Would really appreciate it Hii i am an undergraduate i recently did a course from Coursera about data analysis I did it with the help of MATLAB Software The course name was data analysis with MATLAB to continue my data science learning what should i do next can i self learn data science if my math is incredibly bad like grade standard I just found out my last assessment for the year is going to be a Regression Analysis so this may come in handy I'll be going to General Assembly for Data Science in July I'm currently working on my math and Python skills as I don't have a professional Analytics background coming from Sales I'm really grateful for your insights as to how to make something out of my own circumstance Thank you for sharing your experiences and recommendations if you did it all over I just started my journey to Data Science and have been studying from the ground up to prepare me for a pricey Data Science bootcamp this summer I'll definitely be all over Kaggle and try my own projects Hi Ken great video sharing your advice I've started learning Python for some time now but there is still so much more to learn love the new intro keep up the good work Hi I loved your videos I am learning Data Analyst NOT Data Science with Python https learn datacamp com career tracks from Datacamp and from some other sources as well Do you think is Data Analyst is a good path in terms of career perspectives I am years old and not good with ML stuff Appreciate your time and answer Thanks Ken your videos are very insightful Hi Ken your videos are very informative and everything is to the point so perhaps you can help me understand the role of SQL in data science and to which extent we use SQL in problem solving Hi Ken I just wanted to spend a little bit of my time to thank you for all this great stuff you share with us You have made me feel the motivation to learn something new which I had been missing for a long time Besides this might even mean the change for a more rewarding career I had been looking for Please keep sharing we will support you Thanks again and stay safe during these tought corona times I don't even know what data science is I want to start out as analyst for supply chain or industrial engineering in general Should I be starting out in R or python Appreciate It will be hard for me i dont like collaborating with people because i dont like arguements Your channel is like gold needle inside of haystack Yes but can a data science certificate get you a job as a data analyst I would imagine that it could and then that could be leveraged to get into a data science data engineering role Well i am also thinking to start a career in data science but while learning i got stuck and didn't understand the thought process of that code is this normal Or i need to do something else I see this is what Kylo Ren does in his spare time Teaching data science How much time the one should practice in a day I am now can i learn And Can I do data science job Im views away from views feels bad man I've heard that a great way to eventually end up in a sports position is to work in data for a non sports business first to legitimize yourself and then transition to sports Have you seen this and would you recommend How beautiful it is to work long and hard and alone on a project but also be able to present it and explain it to others AND add real value and impact to the user Thank you Subscribed minutes into Really insightful D This is such a helpful video you are great I have subscribed I am majoring in Accounting and minoring in Data Science what do you think about this path Hi KenJee First of all thank you for your guidance to the community Your content is very informative and to the point I would like to request help in resume preparation I have mailed you Please critique I am a physics phd student and i also work a full time job i knew programming would be someting i will love and master since we first got introduced to pascal years ago and matlab and fortran later that's all we learned but it gave me the basics so now i want to learn Data science for my phd work i could just use a software that everyone else use at the lab to analyse and visualise my experimental data and also to have a job as a DS too it's perfect now with the quarantine i have more then enough time to learn So do you think i can learn DS in months i learned python the last two weeks it's easy but i didn't build any projects yet I love your channel thank you loads Hello ken New subscriber here My current situation is that i've graduated with a Honours in Biochemistry and last year i enrolled into another undergraduate degree in Computer Science because I figured I would switch my career in hopes of finding a job After completing my years I've decided to take on a Data science course on udemy and has since created personal data science projects Do you think that's good enough and that I should apply for jobs or should I just finish my Comp sci undergrad Also loving the content you put out Thanks I loved your contents I have even sent u a connection request on LinkedIn Could you suggest better ways to learn R and BI free of cost Hello sir I'm currently enrolled in computer engineering in university and there are some of the courses which are basic for datascience in my syllabus and i'm willing to get more of data science but I'm confused What can I do for it Will I take free courses or join bootcamp or get online certificate Thanks Ken for an insightful video LIked your analysis particularly your results on posting consistently led to increased viewership and watch time where Days of Posts Days After Posts had times higher viewership and times higher watch time Man the background music is so chilling Started my first EDA Datacamp is the resource I m using I'm in Ireland so the set up is a little different but my original degree was in social science and now I'm doing a higher diploma in Data Science This is a post grad qualification that is an add on to your degree but it's not quite a masters either Personally I'm coinciding that with different online courses or certificates The diploma is two years part time and it is designed for people with no data science background so there is a lot to cram in Naturally there will be area's that i'm weaker in or where the diploma does not go into detail as I would like so I use certificates to fill those gaps Mid term term breaks winter breaks and soon summer breaks are a good time to do these when lectures are no longer running and you've finished up exams In saying that university education in Ireland is a lot cheaper My first degree was free and this higher diploma is around euro in total so I don't mind spending an extra little bit to do some courses in my own time Great channel Hi Ken Great video you gained a subscriber here I like more books rather than videos but I will definitely try kagel At this moment I'm learning R and I'm following these books that I picked Practical Statistics for Data Science read R for Data Science read Introduction to Statistical Learning with R read Elements of Statistical Learning on it Advanced R next Any books you recommend to fill some gaps here Thanks I recently started learning data science and started on this kaggle project of House hold prices I was trying to establish relationship between the time at which houses are sold to the sale price of houses to get motivated Your work is very inspiring I really do enjoy watching your videos Great motivation to go on building my data science career Thank you so much Hey Ken thanks for the video I have a question I hope you could help me answer I have a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree and I would love to transition to the field of Data Science I am planning to do that by enrolling into the Masters Program Another reason why I want to get the Masters is because I am planning to immigrate into another country so getting a degree there would be one of the best options for me as I can't get a job in DS right away During my university years I've been introduced to most of the basic concepts of Statistics and Calculus I've completed a few DS courses online together with some CS and Programming Extension courses My question is do you think getting a Masters degree in Data Science is suitable for me and what are the chances of me getting accepted into the program Thank you very much Is that an Oura ring How is towardsdatascience course Can you please explain how natural simulations like over at Jabrils Primer etc channels are made Thanks How can I get about k to k tweets without retweets please help me out Most of your videos have likes Well done Ken need your help I already know python I have some basic knowledge of statistic and different library used for data visualisation nowhere is my main question of how I can train myself to professionally become a data scientist I tried udemy courses but they were basic I want to learn things that are practically used I did my graduation in computer science engineering so I know how to write code and all I already know python I have some basic knowledge of statistic and different library used for data visualisation nowhere is my main question of how I can train myself to professionally become a data scientist I tried udemy courses but they were basic I want to learn things that are practically used I did my graduation in computer science engineering so I know how to write code and all Bro should i learn algos first or libraries like numpy matplot Great video sir For starters it would be interesting for you to start posting videos on the specifics as you do the projects That means learn by doing Most of the content out there is platitude and generalistic Would be interesting if you started doing that Hey Ken I'm a new subscriber I have really enjoyed watching your videos They're great and very informative I'm interested in data science and data engineering I'm debating between get an MS Computer Science or MS Data Science from DePaul University Would you advise I pursue a CS or Data Science degree if I'm interested in both fields Also I believe that you went to DePaul for your MS Would you recommend DePaul's MSCS or MS Data Science program Thanks I have one question is that to practice project on Kaggle house price for instance if I look on others' work I worry that my own project will be a copy of them cuz I am a beginner what should I do Thanks in advance I like it I like it I like it I like it I like it I like it I like it I like it I like it I like it I like it I like it Hi Ken i have a PhD in mechanical thermal modeling with years of R D design investigation and project management experience i have finish data science core from Edx with a certificate it includes intro to python SQL and essential maths in python i am currently doing anther certification with data science it has modules I had done coding mathematical modeling and matlab script simulation during the working years i had done a lot of maths in high school especially the whole of statistics i am currently thinking of doing a bootcamp in my country which originally cost USD k but able to get a discount down to USD k its is a twelve week course and i plan to take months leave for the course i agree with you about the networking the bootcamp can offer and also skeptical that all the online certificates can land me a data scientist job what do you think thanks in advance great vedios that you had uploaded i learnt a lot Thanks a lot How is machine learning by Andrew ng Course Trying to figure out by learning introductory course in Data Science that what I wanna do in this field Need a over view of Data Science Phew I thought you were going to say For the girls It's a good idea put the articles that helped me in the project in readme Hi everyone I recently decided to try to learn python and ML by myself Although I have a career in finances I have a lot of boring repetition in my work My goal is to understand enough in the next months to year so I can move into more of a financial data analyst I ll provide updates every month or so I will become a Data scientists Full stack web developer entrepreneur Thanks Ken for making this video Can you give any recommendation of a website where I can practice python as a beginner My goal is to deploy a model by the end of this year He is just saying you can learn anything if you are honest to your work For none CS majors what are the top cs topics that once need to master to be successful in data science What are some good resources I started to study Python one week ago and is intimidating but with great people like you is being really enjoyable time Thanks again Hi Ken this is a great video I appreciate you taking the time to talk about this topic in depth If I heard correctly you said it took you five years to get to where you are today Can you shed some more light on that During the last five years were you working as a data scientist analyst or is this something that you pursue in your spare time I am wondering because I am trying to transition into a career related to data science Specifically I would to work in a role related quantitative research in the finance industry I have been studying hours week the last six months and on and off the previous six months I have been using resources such as Datacamp and Quantopian to practice and learn However it is frustrating that I am at the level that I would like to be at and I am beginning to wonder if getting a masters degree in data science or financial engineering would be the better route I would love to get your opinion on self taught vs traditional education Hi Ken it was really great video Need your suggestion here I am currently working as Tech support in well known Firewall company but I want to get out of Support as I do not find rotating shifts good in long run I am thinking to get into Data science It will be kind of new field for me however I know Python basics Is Data scientist Job stressful How much time it take an average to learn tools and tech for DS I like the style of the video very didactic well organized content This is amazing Saving all your videos for future reference too These are super useful thanks for all your help Ken I really liked this video This is my first visit to the channel I've been setting data science learning goals and I've been doing it at an intense pace for about months now This video was very important to me as I was able to review my goals and check if I'm going the right way It seems that I need to get my hands on real projects and show what I can and can't do Always learning Thanks I see you have a copy of Wayne T Winston Well played Great content I am in my job search and It would help me a lot if my resume and GitHub are reviewed Thank you for this content This was really useful many thanks I just have one question how would you recommend me to include a previous experience in developing a business in my CV Thanks a lot again Once again I really thank and appreciate you for the video And I like the approach having people from diverse backgrounds That was really helpful I m a data science student Currently studying data science for my masters I read mechanical engineering for my bachelors and honestly it has been very hard understanding everything That aside the system for my academic calendar doesn t do much to support good self study so I m still a beginner at everything although I ve been doing fairly well with my assignments This makes it hard for me to present myself to companies because immediately they see you re about to be a graduate with an Msc in data science they expect the most from you which is fair but then to someone like me who had zero background in this course before starting it is quite intimidating It makes me wonder if there s ever a company out there who will have the patience to allow me to grow in my knowledge whiles still contributing to the job requirements Hello I am creating videos about data science application for business Feel free to suscribe to my channel if you are interested in this topics D Awesome I think you talked about a lot of points which can be found on beginner portfolios as you have said multiple times already documentation is really important I notice it personally as well once you have of the project finished the last can sometimes be the most tedious even though they are really important I just noticed that your channel pretty much blew up after the last video and I want to congratulate you on that D I was definitely sure that you would hit the k milestone this year but this was really a good amount quicker than I expected so congrats to you that was definitely well deserved Wow you are spot on on everything Good job enjoying your videos So informative and helpful I dont have a cs degree and dont know coding can i do data science So cool to see someone with the same background as me eerily so Although you re a few years ahead I came across your channel recently you explained the things very well what tips would you give me as i am intrested in data science and beginner in this field I'll be waiting for your response Thanks Ken I am currently working on a BS in Comp Science with a certificate in Data Science using electives My plan is to enter the workforce after graduating then work on a MS in Data Science online What are your thoughts on this plan I'm a sales professional and I would like to learn data science course Your videos are full of sense really appreciate it nice vid man was very helpful I have a question is it better when i have one repository for projects which are separated in different folders or for every project i have to make own repository I'm just beginner in github Hi Ken Great video Does it look bad to Data Science professionals if all of an applicant's projects rely on existing packages like scikit learn gensim keras etc Is it significantly helpful to applicants to have their own implementations of regression random forests naive bayes etc in the same way that computer scientist students have their own implementations of sorts and stuff Hey man do you have any contact details which you can share I would really like to ask something privately The lighting for video is seriously under rated Forgot to mention it last time I like the new intro Man you are one productive dude Hey I would be so thankful if you review my GitHub account as well And this video is so informative and I am learning a lot from you I hope to become a good Data Scientist in coming days Thanks again Amazing video who even disliked it not me haha I hit the like button I COMPLETELY SMASHED IT Thank you for the inspiration Also can we see your biceps too Are the courses given in the link above free Is the course in kaggle link free Hey I'm pursuing a commerce or more specifically a finance degree but I'm thinking of going into the data science field So is it like a feasible decision Will my degree even matter Thanks Great video Ken It would have been nice if this video was around when I first started my data science journey A lot of people will benefit from this series Again congrats on k subscribers You deserve more Keep up the good work Ken great insights your suggestions are really supportive Hi I'm and I'm starting in data science I'm learning python from absolubly zero and I have some math knowledge but no programming skills Do you think I'm starting late Could my age be a problem for finding a job on the future Also I'd like to know about remote work It's possible to find out a job like that for a data scientist If you'd make a video about it would be great Recently found your channel and i love it I'm your new sub Yooo liked your video I am an economics student and I am thinking of minoring in Data Science Would you recommend it I have a question I am a beginner in data science So i should learn hadoop spark and stuff like that Keep up the good work I was also thinking about same thing Nice content and perfect background music Lol I have to view all his videos to understand this video Thanks for such a great video I am also planning make some projects for my resume Do you think it will be a minus to use the data from Kaggle than using the data which I obtained from websites by myself Super cool intro for a minute I thought Where is Hello guys it's ken here I tried to search you in kaggle could you tell your kaggle id Thanks Great video Nice intro Special thanks to Raisham for letting me review his portfolio I want to also apologize to him for constantly mispronouncing his name actually pronounced Ray shim If you would like me to review your resume projects or portfolio please let me know in the comments below and send the information to kenjee ds gmail com How times have changed I'm a work from home data scientist Just started this year Thanks so much for the tips and suggestions Definitely will give them a try My coworkers work in a different time zone and so I have to adjust my schedule to match theirs However that's a struggle in of itself as it means late days even though I start late Any suggestions on how I can remedy this Thanks Excellent advice Hello Ken I am fresher graduate I want to strat learning data science from scratch So from where i should start Sir At what age were u a professional data scientist Just curious xD I see you keeping up with your subs goals Good job Let me contribute one as well I just studied Pandas properly Is there any website where i can test my knowledge Just pandas related quiz or questions Please let me know He is one of those good youtubers that people subscribed after watching one video Thank you so much Sir for this series I hope to watch like this in future please recommend me agood laptop for data science Hey You are doing a great job I always enjoy your content and it is informative I am a machine learning student i am practicing machine learning since years now and I am in my rd year of B tech Degree but i do not have any internship Can you please help me out with this I watch your video first time and they are amazing and exactly what I want I know intermediate level of python so what should I do now I've started learning data science through book should I continue this way for few more month or should I try something else Hi Ken jee Happy to have bumped into your channel In your opinion do you think is crucial for data scientist to learn about flask or django This person has JEE in his name That's why he is so hard working XDXD I had read and replied to your comment on the vlogger The Come Up video just now Now looking at your channel this video grabbed my attention I am a coding beginner and I want to become a Data Engineer And I am a USAF Veteran now age BSc Accounting and Finance International Black American student at a UK University And I feel my skills and strengths fit the Data Engineer career Thank you for this insightful video And I have subscribed to your channel how can you enjoy frustration it's most horrible feeling when something doesn't work Awesome videos Ken thank you very much You have a genuine and reassuring way of sharing your knowledge and helpful tips Couldn't appreciate this enough A true diamond in the rough I have seen your subscriptions grow k since I subscribed in the morning meaning Youtube algorithm is doing its thing Puts a smile to my face Hope the same for you Regards sorry the projects done by people on kaggle seems to be very intimating with long analysis and some coding i do not understand Great vid man thanks If we are struggling to land a data science role do you think being a data analyst for a period of time would be a good stepping stone to landing a DS job I found you from another YT channel you just commented on today I am thinking about taking a certification course in Data Science from eCornell What is the best program in NYC would you suggest Hi Ken thanks for your sql tutorial video which is very helpful and inspiring I have a question in regards to subquery you mentioned in the video select bat pitch from dbo Batting as bat inner join select from dbo Pitching where W as pitch on bat playerID pitch playerID and bat yearID pitch yearID where AB instead of using subquery in inner join I use normal inner join and put W in where clause which came out the same result select bat pitch from dbo Batting as bat inner join dbo Pitching as pitch on bat playerID pitch playerID and bat yearID pitch yearID where Ab and W my question is when should we use subquery it looks complicated and easy to make a mistake during usage My goal is to learn the basics of machine learning and data pre processing in months Thank you for this Ken Great book references I too have recently started to learn the basics of data science and honest y kaggle is one of my favorite sites to find interesting datasets to work with I took bio as my major in high school and had dropped maths in my last year so the concepts of statistics and probability and linear algebra got me scared at first but after I spent hours completing courses in those subjects tons of pdfs and youtube channels and online courses I feel pretty confident in my effort and knowledge And I cant wait to dig deeper in this fascinating field of data science Sir I'm from India I recently started my path toward data scientist I want to buy a laptop My maximum budget is What specifications are important as a beginner and I can also use it for the task I'm asking you because you have a experience Everywhere I seen people suggest about expensive laptops but now can't afford that much of price Please Suggest me a good laptop in my budget Nice overview Great idea to show folks how to get started I m aiming to bring more into the space of Master Data Management in Healthcare Hi Ken My main goal in the next years to become a proficient data scientist Because I recently only discovered my passion for data science and I did my bachelor's in Urban planning Now I have to learn quickly all the concepts and be competent in applying those into real world problems which I am sure I can But my only worry is to get an entry level job in the data science field since I don't have any paper qualifications or experience from my current job Any tips on that how I could land a new job in this field to gain experience Ken this is fantastic Thank you I would start by not learning it and start learning software engineering Data scientist are looked down in the tech industry Any software engineer can do their job but it is boring as hell Apart from that your end product is nothing but a power point or report showing your results Who would feel proud of that Your favorite coder is Gilfoyle i guess You talk like him LOL Video starts from Hi Is it mandatory to be a software developer if I want to work in ML in other word are all ML engineers are software developer I am an EEE person interested in ML I know C MATLAB and python but i don't have any idea about frontend or backend web development as well as software development So for me will it be wise to spend time learning ML my goal now is to learn DATA SCIENCE in the course of next months This is the best video ever on Scraping tweets from Twitter Is there any provision for getting tweets for a particular keyword depending on number of followers I get solutions for my every problem by your videos Thank You very much Keep going sir Hi Ken love your channel and reviews I got few couple of DL projects posted on my github https github com McDo and also I've created a little webapp that helps to explore similar clothes on instagram using tensorflow js https aidope com I'll be glad to have reviews from you if you are interested Hello Kane Please guide on the exact course skills to be acquire relavent topics one can study to become Data analyst Specific this component only for non programming individuals only I can't see any crisp content or precise topics one should master For eg How much which type of modules in python for Data analysis What topics in Statistics for Data analysis What depth in SQL and so on the list is long So please throw some light Thanks for the points I'm suuuper excited to start my DS internship Your monitor has a TN panel and doesn't support wide viewing angles I'm guessing that this is for a reason What reason could that be Might take up ml course in iisc Bangalore I agree with the part you go practice first and see if theory fits it This is exactly how I would advise to other jr data scientists that I train Hi Keen I really enjoy your videos do you think is a good idea to start the first project making one model of linear multiple regression or it should be a bit more complicated Thank you thank you very helpful to the point what why now I have to look at your other videos and subscribe Hey I have just stumbled upon your channel as I was trying to find some good resources regarding data science I am currently a third year student doing a computer scene degree with integraded masters Next year I have the option to choose some optional modules like Machine learning technologies or foundations of data science What do you think I should take Should I take the ML course and try to understand data science in my free time I can only take one of those Sorry for the long comment Your countent is great and I cant wait to see some more stuff from you Love the intro Awesome video Data science is a very vast field Everyday I feel I know nothing and have a lots to learn Thanks for the video It is really helpful I am an IP consultant I develop interest in Data Science during this lockdown my goal is to become a good data analyst by Jan do you think it is realistic Thanks for this video Very very helpful I have years of experience working in bioinformatics and dealing with big data from genomics and genetics I have been looking into transitioning to sports analytics as a new career option I do have basic data science skills from my bioinformatics work experience but I don't have any specific projects I have done independently in the sports domain Do you think it would be useful for me to pursue a sports analytics degree before I start looking for opportunities in this domain Or would the sports industry still consider me as an eligible candidate based on my programming machine learning experience while handling big data in the biology domain even if I don't have real world experience in sports I do follow several sports enthusiastically such as football soccer and basketball and I am aware of all the terminologies associated with these sports I'd really appreciate your feedback Thanks What wide monitor do you have Ken thanks for all of the informative advice Do you think your Masters in Commerce which lead you into a analyst role provided you any significant foundation for programming data science Also is the switch from data analytics to data science difficult vert helpfull video can u pls help me to know about the process of being a Computer Analyst on Cricket it will hlp me a lot if u do thanks best wishes for u Such videos are made by people who want to earn money while trying to become a Data Scientist I'm having hard time learning data structures and algorithms in python Any suggestions to accelerate learning process I've just started learning Data science and interested in football analytics a lot Should i start with big projects immediately or should I go gradually Also it'd be really helpful if you could post a tutorial video of your analysis And if it's not a trouble do you mind if i contact you via LinkedIn Also can you suggest some online communities to engage with Was nice to see near the end of the video that even you too had to look something up Further backed up your video saying that no real data scientist memorizes everything We appreciate you for all that your doing Hello Ken I love your videos thanks so much for it Do you use SQL in your projects In other videos usually the people recommend start by SQL due the amount of data what do you think Hello Ken Very nice video as usual I've started my Data Science journey a few weeks ago and I agree with your comments I'm an engineer and work with computational mechanics for a while now so I have a quite good understand about algorithms programming optimization and stuff like this What I figured out is that I already know some stuff about DS just the terminology I was used to is different which is great I have in mind to create my own much worst version of scikit learn I mean to implement the major ML algorithms myself as you suggested What I think it's also very useful is to create my own cheat sheets and reference notebooks instead of just using some source already available because this will force me to think more Going through the packages' documentations and checking all functions that might be useful can also be a good idea and this is slightly easier if the person has already some coding experience I enjoy Coursera courses and I'm relying on them to build my basic skills but definitely what will help me most is to write my own codes Cheers sick new intro hi sup u know which platforms or web that offers FREE certificates thx Hey Ken Thanks for valuable info A quick Q A can should data science learn online as you know lots of video will be find here of hrs to hrs learning OR need to go through proper channel of learn like enroll in paid classes with renounced institute What's your opinion Thanks for this video I am an analyst trying to decide if I want to become a data scientist but it seems like some of the things I dislike about my role may be the position and not the company I'm the only analyst with nobody to ask questions less prof development opportunities and nobody knows what I do The autonomy expert thing kills me I'd much rather have a team and people who understand benefit of my work Have you experienced being in your own little corner or being way ahead of your companies' resources You rock Ken Hey Ken hope you are doing good Thanks for all the videos Enjoying it thoroughly In learning with case studies how do I know which algorithm I should choose Also can you upload a project that starts with data collection which has a lot of missing values in it where more time is spent on data cleaning and pre processing as I heard from many DataScientist that they spend the majority of their time in Data preprocessing Great video as usual Thanks Ken on my first day i studied for too long well about hours I just finished watching and i did burn out and didn't go back to work for days i felt exhausted Im just starting with programing like from the very very beginning I've already been using the nba api but i want to know what else can i do with that to learn more I want to be a statistician in my future Any Tips Thanks for your videos they are helping Ive also purchased Mathletics and its very good First of all a huge thanks to you for bringing this exclusive content for us If you could can you review the curriculum of this Data Science MSc programme https www gla ac uk postgraduate taught datascience tab structure I have an offer for this programme and I'm from a computer science background with minimal stats knowledge I need to build a distributed recommendation system for an e commerce to improve the UX from reatilers and servieces in my country Features would be from consumers perspective Recommendations of alike products most vieew products such as you search processing text from a written list of products and searching the data base for those prodcuts users personalize input to search for best fit question for this woudl be what categoriy of product you would like to buy this could be on or varous catergories Do you want the lowest to the highest price or you dont care do you want the nearest to the fardest location ansd so on from retail perspective profille of users goal clint setting of weekly and monthly goals reocomendation of which products to buy from markets feedback recommendation of products to buy from two alike products based on demand profit cost and snetiment of consumers about the product sentiment analysis from consumers to products of the retailer sentiment analysis from consumers to overall perfomrance of retailer data visualization and son on Anybody could help me on gettin started about recomemndation systems Awesome video Ken I'm about month in so far I enrolled in data science Definitely filled in the gaps of my learning Hi Ken can you do a desktop set up video to maximise productivity Helpful video Should I go for Data Science if I want to work as a remote employee Should I go for learning Data Science if I am years of old having business graduation majoring in MIS database management system Thanks for sharing this What courses should one take for probability and statistics Thank you sir for this video Was keen to know about getting into sports analytics Python with their libraries Thank you for the informative content Helped a lot New goal for Ken Use rule of thirds in videos A data scientist from my firm told me JavaScript will be very useful to learn as a data scientist How does that come into play Sweet right on time I'm a Mech Engineer just got my first job as an engineer but I've lost total interest for it Data science might be the career for me Thanks for the tips Good luck to everyone thinking of a career change or those studying We got this Liking your new intro and B roll Thank you so much for the advice Dataquest does a good job of covering all that in one place aside from personal projects though they do have projects It s been worth the money I'm currently finishing up law school between now and July when I have to submit my thesis Between now and the end of August though I would like to get through the intro to stats course Python programming course as well as Data Science course I do have to be extremely careful of burnout as you pointed out However I am extremely motivated to make this transition into Data Science There's a Data Science bootcamp here in Toronto that I'm keen to attend which I'd hope to start in October I'd like to go into that Bootcamp with a solid base as most of the attendees in the Data Science stream seem to have solid technical experience Thank you for providing your insights its always good to have some guidance from the people already in the domain Hey Ken Thank you for all your videos I was wondering if this changes any for people pursuing sports analytics I was also wondering how to start with projects for sports analytics I am currently years old and am trying to learn coding and statistics during this time through free edx and coursera but I still don't seem to be able to do any projects especially ones that are new and intuitive I want to publish new work but over summer if I am only good enough to do projects that maybe others have done is that still worth publishing Thank you for any advice What course did you mentioned in Machine Learning Sir can you make video on how to get into sports analytics Is it only for windows or else we can install on windows also I m having my project please do reply sir Love your content buddy i wanted to know what are your thoughts on IBM data science course offered by Coursera because i have undertaken this course and many others have as well i just wanted to know where will it take me Merci from France Ken do you have any sport analysis resources that you can recommend Thanks Ken for a great video on the roadmap of learning data science The intro animation graphics looks awesome Well said accountability indeed helps to keep us motivated and pushing it to meet the goals we set Being accountable for one another in this comment community is surely a great way to move forward in learning data science together Hey Ken could you do a project from scratch that would involve feature selection feature scaling PCA data normalization etc I did see your series of Data Scientist job positions from scratch but would like to know how the above concepts are incorporated in the project Thanks Really insightful thank you for this video would you recommend coursera courses im studying IBM's data science courses rn and i wonder if these certificates help me to get data science internship or make a project Love the new intro Ken Definitely agree with staring projects as soon as you can I spent too much time learning about functions and things I could do but constantly forgot them because I was never doing projects and applying them Alot of my time was spent learning things but I never knew when or how to apply them because I never did projects at first Firstly thanks for sharing your knowledge I live n Brazil and I'm graduate in Computer Engineer recently signed a premium plan on DataCamp and I'm enjoying it I discovered Data Science by your recommendation at the start of this pandemic Their videos are highly informative and involve very detailed projects that will help you understand key concepts as well as open the door for you to start making your own types of projects through what you will have learned So I definitely recommend them as well Goal is to learn the basis of ML in the next months I'm going to come back to this comment Hello Ken If you could you suggest the order in which a person should learn ML algorithms I would be very gratefull to you Thanks Thank you sir please make a video on deep learning its really difficult to learn that Your videos really inspire me a lot Very helpful thankyou for dedicating your precious time to guide beginners like me Hey Ken just wanted to show some support to you All your videos are super helpful and fun to watch Keep up the good work That new intro of yours does look really cool I have to say D I agree to the statement that DS has really changed over the past few years Because it is such a young field I think that the landscape will change dramatically even for the next years My personal goal as a now first year university student is to stand out amongst my peers more than of every CS student seems to be interested in ML but only a very small percentage of those really commit to the entire journey which I really want to do Have a nice weekend Great content Now please make a video on how to start freelancing in data science Thanks for watching everyone Please leave some of your data science goals below so you can be held accountable by the community on this channel Also feel free to like and subscribe to help this channel grow Watch this video on why I am starting data science over again next https www youtube com watch v uXLnbdHMf w ab channel KenJee Video on how I learned data science https www youtube com watch v n vw M RrPU Written version of this article https towardsdatascience com how i would learn data science if i had to start over f bf d ca I didn t know about Kaggle micro courses That will come in handy I have found that many people on Kaggle could have tough me a lot if they had documented their notebooks better I learn a great amount by doing as much as possible from scratch at least once Thanks for another good video Hey All I want to say is THANK YOU You have been mentoring me for quite some time now Thanks for watching everyone I would love to hear about the projects you are working on in the comments section below Thanks for watching everyone The link to the mathletics book is located here https amzn to k vfv Its explained really good Also switched to Spyder IDE now Its way better in my opinion than VSCode Hey Ken Would you say that the typical workday of a data scientist is quite isolated I love the concept of data science and statistics but I am also a very social person and am worried that becoming a data scientist will cause me to have an unhappy work life e g constantly sitting in front of a computer the entire day not enough interaction etc Please let me know your thoughts and thank you once again for all of your content Amazing analysis Honest feedback Ken Can't wait for your video on Building your personal website ty Hi Ken I am an italian master's degree student in computer science and this kind of videos are pure gold I have a question since I'm currently attending classes are there ways to work on projects of this type let's say freelance I would like to start making a bit of money but without affecting the lessons thanks Oh so happy to have found you Specific books or tips for cricket analysis I'm looking into this field and this video was really helpful Thank you for your insight Hello there I have a question I know next to nothing about maths but are you taking in consideration the fact that Shaq has two separate shots or free throws while Steph only has one shot Let's think about a coin toss example the probability to land heads twice is equal to so let's say Shaq has a success rate at shooting freethrows wouldn't it be his expected buckets hey man i'm from Brasil and i'm starting a project of soccer data analysis Your videos are realy helping me out Thank you for absolute beginner with high school math what do u recommend where i should begin statistics or discrete math etc and can u recommend a source cheers I found this series to be incredibly valuable Loved the format Thanks for the effort put into this one Ken your videos really help alot Great tip about putting accomplishment then method Subscribed keep it up I like the k upload too Awesome video for beginners thanks for your insight do you have videos on steps of data exploration and preparation as well Thank you so much for your guidance This is some life changing advice for someone committed to finding a new rewarding career Hi Everyone can anyone please assist with this error StaleElementReferenceException stale element reference element is not attached to the page document Session info chrome I don't get this error unless I try to scrape a large number of jobs which is weird Thnx a lot man this was fantastic Looking forward for your next projects I would suggest 'Sentiment Analyses' thnx again for your hard work This is great Ken I'll be sharing some of my projects with you once I get a hang of git i have a question i already have my masters in science been doing data for years but want to learn more joining a data science bootcamp to movie on and upgrading a job does this helps Please refer to this playlist about resume and project improvements https www youtube com playlist list PL zq klxX ARnFpk JauioZb zyxNZek I'm not sure about this but I think you have to try to change scenes and sometimes have just daily stuff like making coffee or something Because for me it's a little bit boring to always watch on talking pretty guy Yeah but your content is great keep going Great stuff as usual I hope you will do one I will make in the future Do you have any tips on data science forums I have a great python forum but its more towards web dev ets But really helpful bunch Thanks for talking about your inefficiencies as well as what you did correctly Thanks for good advices I'd like to work in future as a Data Scientist but the essential element for me is having a partner to learn or do something together and I wonder where can I find a group of people to do a project together Amazing content Waiting for your tutorial on how to build a website and host it on Github Thank you Found your Article on Medium and now i am watching your channel really informative thanks man keep up the good work Title of the background instrumental pls thankyou this is very helpful also could you make a video on data visualization hey Ken thank you so much saved me lots of time I have a question about feasibility say I want to see all these hashtags right tweets query tweets yahoo begindate begin date limit limit then I get the output screen name username etc Can I also see next to username the number of Followers and following For each user pulled And if yes what'd be the syntax please Awesome video picked up on a couple of things I never would have guessed Also the personal website through github is something I'd defintely look forward to seeing Cheers A lot of the described disadvantages aren't as bad in the UK Courses are all around k k dollars and we're given standardised student loan Also once you're accepted into the course you tend to be allowed to select any module you want even if there are advertised prerequisites Helpful content nonetheless I was accepted into three programmes and realised that only one of them had a robust syllabus Strangely enough it also happened to be the cheapest one The cash grab thing is true I really like how you stress the important parts and flesh out the points with bits of practical explanation like you did with the resume layout or the documentation This really is good advice and definitely a resource a lot of people who are not incredibly experienced in the field can benefit from I don't have a lot more to say than just the fact that I enjoyed watching it and thank you for the helpful insights Really like this kind of series Definitely helpful for the aspiring data scientists How about a video on how to build a personal portfolio website Hey Ken great video as always Would it be possible for you to make a video on some examples of technical interview questions I was looking through your channel and couldn't find such videos Hope this is not too much to ask for Thanks great video ken Ken Great video and insights on preparing a strong resume Agreed that documentation is a plus for potential employers a well documented code notebook goes a long way in reproducibility of data science projects Speaking of making websites and hosting on GitHub Hugo https gohugo io is a great tool it is a static site generator that automatically creates a website directly from markdown files and it could be hosted on the github io Best of all there's a large selection of themes to select from Personally I use it to create our research group's website http codes bio Hi Ken This video was very helpful I would really appreciate the video idea you mentioned of how to build your own website on Github I have one on Wix but I think having one on Github would be better Thank you Thank you for continuing the series I have a question lets just suppose I have done or more online courses regarding data science what do you recommend putting on the courses sections all the courses of some specific If some specific one then how to choose which one Thanks in advance Another awesome video Would you make a video going over LinkedIn tips I am an absolute beginner All this years i realised i always learnt the theory first the details first but i wanted to try if i can look up into a project and build curiosity and then work on basics This really helped Thank you Regards mech Engineer Hi Ken What do you mostly do at work Build models clean data or something else Hi Everyone While editing this video Vishnu said it was fine to use his name etc why his info is not blurred on his github Special thanks to him for letting me do this Vishnu's github can be located here https vishnubharadwaj github io If you would like me to review your resume projects or portfolio please let me know in the comments below and send the information to kenjee ds gmail com This a cool idea should do one once a week Hi Ken When you did the search for excel you forgot to change df aws to df excel which is why you got the exact same count Hi ken your videos are wonderful I have been going through a couple of your videos and found them quite informative relevant Thanks for sharing your diverse experience here and giving us a head up Please keep putting new stuff Hey How do you feel about this article https www datasciencecentral com profiles blogs data scientists automated and unemployed by Do you think automation is a real risk to a data science career Hi Ken do you know if it would be possible to scrape the history of the draft Great advice I hate interviews and really don t look forward to them I choke and get really stressed I perform better when allowed to produce something rather then answer on the top of my head I really enjoyed watching your videos To be honest i worked with the same Glassdoor dataset you used but now i'm planning on doing the same steps with another dataset How can i export the pandas DataFrame for the scraped tweeter data as CSV to save on my system memory Great video Generally I think the younger someone is or in general the earlier someone stands in their career education the more impressive extraordinary projects become If you're a high school student and you create your own DS project whilst collecting own data that is a lot more impressive than if you're in your final graduate year Even though it is never too late to start I really want to try and make cool projects early on so that I can build momentum as early as possible With the DS market becoming more and more competitive I think these uncommon achievements are going to be valued more and more especially in larger companies FANG etc where already today they are probably more of a requirement than an add on Nevertheless great video I really hope to land an awesome internship myself in the coming year s Thanks for explaining stroke gained clearly It is very informative Hi I would like to know how to get fake and real labeled news using twitterscrapper First of all is it possible to do something like that I am very new to this Hey Ken great video as always Curious to hear your thoughts on the Spyder IDE as I saw it being used in this video Any standout reasons you use it over Jupyter VSCode etc Hey Ken thanks for the great video I have been watching all your videos and they are greatly helpful I have a question though At you mentioned that if you want to set yourself apart you should consider doing unique projects on the dataset you personally collected Are there any efficient ways I can collect new dataset Hey Ken great video So I have done a project where ive scrapped data from a website performed EDA and built a classifier analysing the performance of various ML model How exactly do you suggest mentioning this on my resume Like can you give me an example on how to go about writing it Thanks Great video Ken hope you don t mind me sharing I ve hosted interns every year and agreed with all your points particularly the successful interns were those with the skills you ve mentioned e g R or Python as well as a GitHub portfoilio of hobby projects reaffirming their interest and passion for data science And one of the most important point is to double check that we addressed the potential employer with their name instead of Dear Sir Madam it goes to show that we have at least personalized the letter to them Once again great video and great insights Ken Hi Ken Thanks for sharing helpful tips I wish I found your advices in earlier years in college I m a new graduate without any intern experience Can you give me an idea of how I can find research opportunities at this point Thanks in advance have you used deep learning neural network techniques in your projects Thanks for the tips I had planned a astronomy machine learning internship at a university in PA for the summer The program has since been cancelled due to COVID But luckily I applied to a data science intern position at a startup and got it I totally agree with your points Thanks your share i'm a nd software engineering student but i want to become a ds in the future I'm really not good in math can you give me some advice sir This video inspired me to look into internships for this summer something I wasn't planning on doing because I didn't think I was qualified Thank you for asking Helpful videos Keep up the great work Mr Jee you vedios are really helpfull Sir I am nd year engineering student and I wanted to explore data analysis in sports field please guide me Sir please make an video of Complete Sports data analysis based project from scratch Hi Ken Thank you so much for the clear explanation When I run the code I encounter the problem of thread 'Supervisor' crashed AttributeError 'IMapUnorderedIterator' object has no attribute ' write to' Do you or does someone has an idea how I can fix this Been stuck for days and the deadline of my thesis is coming up fast Thanks in advance Hey Ken It's very interesting as I am beginner it makes me more curious to learn new concepts and I am following all your playlist Thank you very much It seems a very informative video Just like it I was also wondering for the regression since you use dummies shouldn't you throw the base level of the categorical variables to solve any multicollinearity issues Hi Ken very informative series I would love other series like this dealing with other data science techniques such as deep learning reinforcement learning or other machine learning techniques Hey can we fetch details of a user say followers and following count through an email on twitter instead of the user name or handle hey ken can you do a video about the types of data science data analytics software we should be familiar with for beginners Great content I am in final year of Computer Science undergrad I am focusing on becoming a Data Scientist and your video on essential list of projects for resume gave me a clear idea of where I should be heading Getting insights from a Data Scientist helps a lot in getting a clear sense of direction Hi Ken How do I scrape based on hashtags is that possible with this module Hi Ken Jee this is great tutorials thank you so much that's what i'm looking for I'm watching all the series in a night perfect for the beginners Greetings from Barcelona Thank you so much Your tutorial is so helpful hell ya So happy you decided to start this series Ken For those of us who are already getting hands on with our own projects hopefully most of us this is going to be a monumentally helpful series I unsubbed just so I could sub again haha he Ken Jee thnx the great tutorials really loving them I'm trying to replicate what you did as a way of learning i'm still in the learning phase of programming however when i load the page i get a ' cookie consent' pop up As a result the scraping doesn't continue however when i manually press 'accept cookies' it does continue Do you know a way i can hard code this in python so that when the page opens it automatically excepts the cookies too Hey Ken today I mark the first day of learning in Data science field I'm a mechanical engineering graduate and have embryonic knowledge on statistics I've enrolled myself in one MOOC program and plan to gradually enhance my leaning curve Can you point on some pertinent points I should keep in mind while I pursue my first phase of learning Also want to thank you for your informative videos Super Helpful Please do these kinds of videos Hey Ken weird question but what is the salary like as a Sports Analytics Im guessing it obviously depends how what rank of Sports field you are in E g NBA WNBA NBA G League etc Thanks Very nice video Studymotivationalsachinjoshi Hi Ken thanks for the series I'm currently at Around halfway through running the iterations I'm receiving an error saying the element is not clickable at point Other elements would receive the click div class gdGrid noPad Do you know why I am currently learning machine learning and want to step in cricket analytics part what all should I start working on to get the right path Love it Keep up the great work How much time do you use on your channel a week Great hands on tips and insight thanks ken Scheduling the entire day and putting my phone away in a separate room are tips that I will try this week Thank you Ken Hey Ken warning longer comment incoming I've been following you for a few months now and I've been thinking Man I really need to write a comment stating how much I appreciate this channel but I have been putting it of for long enough this video finally drove me to the keyboard It is really inspiring to see you consistently trying to upload informative videos about Data Science and really giving back to the community You are a great motivation for me to keep going and striving towards a career in Data Science or even Machine Learning Engineering I clicked through your social links and noticed that you have a really well documented system including your GitHub personal website Medium posts and this YouTube Channel With a full time job besides all of that it is really impressive to me how you can manage all of these sources and be so consistent with it I'd love to have my project reviewed by you even though at the moment my GitHub is my least well documented source xD But you definitely inspired me to put more time and effort into polishing personal projects and really not letting loose on those last I am almost certain that within a year or two your channel will become very impactful in the DS community and that you will see very positive results Your content is very informative and helping If I tried to point out some minor areas of improval it would actually not be based on the content itself but rather on aspects surrounding it such as presentation background noise but I am sure you are aware of this recently I have noticed quite some improvement in those areas as well so all I can say is chapeau I am really excited to see how far you will come in the next months you definitely won me as a loyal fan of yours Which headphones do you have Super helpful would love to see more of these I've been having trouble on how to get my repositories get to the next level This video really is a great reference on where to go Thanks Ken Would love to see more such videos Thanks Let's hit that k mark Looks like you need a haircut haha Enjoyed watching what your day looks like Great new video series on project review Ken Nice video Ken Please refer to this playlist about resume and project improvements https www youtube com playlist list PL zq klxX ARnFpk JauioZb zyxNZek Hi Everyone If you are interested in having your projects portfolio or resume reviewed in a video please let me know in the comments below Also send an email to me at kenjee ds gmail com with a link to your project resume etc Again please only send in to the email if you are comfortable with having your work reviewed on video Really cool Hey Everyone Thanks for watching the video If you have any questions please leave them below I also can't stress enough how important projects are for learning data science I highly recommend watching the other videos that I have pinned at the end of this one to learn more about them I tried using lambda functions the way u are using to mark as if data have 'developer' But i am getting error TypeError argument of type 'float' is not iterable a 'developer' a 'MainBranch' apply lambda x if 'developer' in x else Main branch contains statements something like below Ex I am a developer by profession I am student I am working as a hobby Please let me know what mistake I am doing MOre Hmm I just found out I don't match any of these Which in fact makes me consider becoming DS I have completed my degree in Software Engineering I was actively looking into data science roles What do you think I should include in my resume and also I was taking a data science Bootcamp course on Udemy will that be good enough to apply for data science roles Man you re doing a great job I just found your channel and found it very interesting with decent amount of insightful contents that I will look into Cheers and keep it up Subscribed Im beginning my Data Scientist journey I should add a lesson no matters your credentials your work your position your company or your experience all makes code as they want so dont worry about doing code this way or that Only focus on keep moving Learning is forever Foun today your channel Great content what is your monitor model lol Thank you for the video It s always so useful to actually see some real projects that people work on You got my thumb up Thanks for making this video Would you think this is a good project that I could do with Python data libraries Analyzing why ticket sales are very high for a specific horror film compared to the US Fascinating I could listen to this for hours Had no idea analytics was involved in recruiting Would love to hear more about how you might help a team develop strategies on how to beat a specific opponent I appreciate what you sent me on LinkedIn a month or so ago but I'm very behind on my reading George Musick Bruh min increments Hope you enjoyed tikka Indian spicy Thats how Indian dishes are Bro you are really good at it k is a cake Great channel answered most of my questions that I ve been having about starting out in DS Question should ML be learned before doing projects I m average in R getting better everyday but feel as if I don t have enough DS skills to start doing projects without knowing any ML Thoughts Hi I just completed way college degree four months ago did data science course with getsmarter Now my question is on my LinkedIn profile should what words should I use as head should I put data scientist for recruiters to find me or just write a graduate I don't know Plz help Cheers another question I have is what do u mean by projects what is an example of a project I could do What would u recommend to me a year old who is absolutely obsessed with baseball analytics and data and is very good with math someday that discord link will exist maybe it might be the best data science discord who knows Thanks for the great content Ken You're the DS YouTube GOAT Keep it coming Yo what ide is that at Great video Very interesting Lol mine is wake up go to work come home throw a pc at the wall sleep and repeat also I m from Chicago Are good programming skills required to become a data scientist Are data scientists software engineers or rather mathematical model builders What breed is your dog Imma guess and say box terrier Hey ken Great video as usual Gotta watch your DS project series for tomorrow Thanks Ken for sharing your day you have a good disciplined routine and awesome video editing Liked the YouTube goals if you don t mind how did you forecast the numbers Hey I noticed the books goal Do you have a book you can point to as to having the most impact on your life Data Science related or not Ken did you ever used opencv or any other python library in sorts And try to predict something making time for that physical activity is so important I definitely gotta work on that a little more cool video Thanks for watching everyone The best part of my day is usually getting outside or exercising What is your favorite part of your routine I relate a lot with this video the Excel goal thing al the paper in the walls in the room Nice video A lot more personal My friends would say that I was absolutely delusional HaHa In college for our baseball team I found that taking the R RA and applying the Pathagorean Theorem taking the power of instead of was more accurately predictive of college baseball programs when using a linear best fit Thanks for the video really helpful what you suggest if having master degree in computer science and work experience as an ETL Developer bit part of data engineer Also how u see positive ans negative point of work experience as an etl Developer will help to moving to data Science Sir This is prajwal graduated with bachelors in mechanical engineering in the year who has year of work experience in procurement Business Development I have got a offer for M tech in Data Science Engineering Is it advisable to accept this offer as I have don't have any knowledge on any programming languages with a basic knowledge on coding in C programming Kindly guide me in accepting this offer or to reject this as i suppose I may find it difficult during the tenure of this course Waiting for your reply this is a really good video for us thank you yes I have downloaded chrome driver and saved in same folder But chrome driver is bit and my laptop is bit support Please help as I'm beginner and I find really interesting your channel Hi Ken Thank you so much for this series This series is such a huge boost for people like me who are trying to learn data science on their own I have a question regarding the data cleaning In the video you manually scrolled through the data to find odd values such as 'per hour' 'employer provided salary' etc in the Salary Estimate column But how would you find that kind of value when the data frame has hundreds of thousands or millions of rows Is there any function or way to find those odd data without manually scrolling or searching File C Users Shukla Documents ds salary proj glassdoor scraper py line in get jobs options webdriver ChromeOptions NameError name 'webdriver' is not defined Sir I'm getting this error again and again Please help me out This is really cool and a great insight to what you do and how you do it Love the variety of video topics while staying within Data Science It was an honor to present this information to almost Kellogg MBA students If you have any questions about the topics please leave them in the comments section below Also a link to my website playingnumbers com is in the description Awesome talk Ken Great insight on the vs shot range Also great insight on the AI augmented human intuition Learned a lot on sports analytics thanks Ken cant wait for basketball golf File C Users Shukla Documents Glassdoor start py line in module import glassdoor scraper as gs File C Users Shukla Documents Glassdoor glassdoor scraper py line In SyntaxError invalid syntax i am getting this error Hi Ken Super helpful video One thing that worried me was your second point as I am a rd data science major at UCSD and I am not looking to go back to grad school I also don't have that much under my portfolio or much experience but I am currently working on personal projects on the side and applying to internships I was wondering if you were in this situation would there be any additional steps that you would take Excellent work Ken Your 'soup to nuts' approach is extremely helpful to those like me who are brand new to data science On top of everything I like how you show us your use of Git and GitHub as well as all of the lambda functions Keep it up Hey Ken really good content as always keep the projects coming One question I was trying to run the script and for some reason the Salary fields were all coming in as the same salary estimate usually the first job that was copied Any reason why you could see this being the case Thank you Keen for this series I ll be thankful if I'll see more videos from you Good Job Man Wonderful Series Ken just watched it I Learned a lot throughout the videos thank you Looking forward to the next series Ken Jee Thanks It's a great video I want to ask is it possible to scrap a hashtag data which tweet by people of particular country I still don't have enough experience in using python but am amazed in all the magic' that it can do Great job Ken You're amazing These are great tips for me since I myself work from home Also the two articles you listed in your description are eye opening to me Ur videos are amazing Just getting started into Data Science and your channel is a god's gift to me Keep up the good work Absolutely loving the B roll Great vid Another tip I would add is get dressed like you are actually going into the office Sir can you say the books that you liked most to be a data scientist please make a video on that Thanks Ken for the work from home tips agree with you that a dedicated work space helps to boost productivity What also works for me is a good background music as a sort of white noise helps to be in the zone I have been working Studying form home for years And first points you have mentioned is what I already follow Thanks for watching Let me know down here in the comments section the biggest thing you are struggling with when WFH I have worked and studied from home for many years and agree with you on that one is Key separate the roles is not that easy I find it I usually don't have much downtime before it did for the day but minutes here and there when needed But I do make a prioritized task list I have turned off all notifications except SMS and phone calls I have my big break as a workout in the garage around mid day is also a great tip Yeah no progress for me haha You did not as for my opinion but I wanted to share to point out that even though we don't do the same things our goal is structure Thanks for shared your knowledge One question in before video part the file eda data csv did no exist in this video you work with that file where does it come from Thanks Really Thanks man I do appreciate your Contents Hope that your channel grows more Are you able to manage the lag between actual and predicted values in my case for Python in Windows Anaconda prompt in Administrator mode run this code conda install c conda forge wordcloud solved Or Download

will be referring to this series often Again you're a star I'm and I want to work in this type of type of job Thank you for making and uploading this Really clear and helpful I am making sport analytics videos on my channel so would love your feedback damn man your honesty for this data science topic made me subscribe your channel and your content as well I'm also doing some online data science courses Love from India helped me a lot thanks Hello Ken You are doing great job I just want to suggest you things Zoom on the coding part bcuz its very hard to read code when you are on mobile Use jupyter notebook instead of this As the interface is very clear and friendly i want to learn data science from the starter Sounds like Gilfoyle from Silicon Valley Excited for the series very informative video Thank you Can anyone recommend any good Bootcamp Thanks in advance Hi Ken Your video really inspires me a lot Keep up the good work and hope I will be as good as you one day Thank you so much for this series As a freshman getting my bachelors in data science this series helped me out a lot in terms of what to do when creating a project and how to overcome obstacles Currently we are just learning how to code and haven t gone through the whole process as you showed us in this amazing series So I wanted to ask you if there s anything you suggest for me to do this summer to learn more skills and gain more experience in the data science field Thanks for creating this series Watched and liked all parts back to back Very informational and useful Looking forward to learn more from you Hi kenn I tried running the code in Google colab and have even specified the path of chrome driver in environment variable found the following error PS I have downloaded the latest

to see more videos like this and what if anything you would change about this series Thanks Cant wait for sports predictions What's pre requisite to do a exploratory data analysis Python pandas May be statistics and Dude you are a fucking good thanks a lot very easy and useful regards from Chile but I have I doubt and I hope you can help me how can I get tweets just tweeted by one user example a media outlet thanks in advance Hi Ken Thank you so much for your video I am wondering if you mind helping me with two more problems First when scraping a thread using twitter scraper the result only shows the first tweet of that threat How can I scrape all the tweets of a thread Second how can I use twitter scraper to scrape the comments and retweets of specific tweets Look forward to your reply Through watching your video I realized that my school DS project which was to compare error rates of different classification algorithms won't count as much as the topics you mentioned I should really work more on new projects As a recent undergraduate I want to start with Titanic classification project And House price regression project sounds fun too Thanks for the recommendations Your explanation is so Clear and easy to understand i learned so much from you ken Hey Ken really good content thank you so much Just wanted to suggest a change I guess the jobs append code in the bottom part is supposed to be outside the if condition by mistake you put it inside Ken I can't over emphasize the importance of this video series to me Practical insightful and indepth Using real life practical examples keep up the good work much thanks Hey Ken I'm building a ML model in google colab can I make rest API using google colab Please don t stop making data science videos Ken Incredible stuff More sports analysis models potentially Great content Hey Ken great video as always I was wondering whether next you could create a step by step introductory guide to GitHub and how to properly use it to store our projects after creating them on jupyter notebooks Looking forward to your reply Very excited that we get another video You're a saint Ken Love the world's best boss mug Great video Ken One question in the train test it is common in the industry to train at and test at or does it depend on a factor that I don't know about a brief answer will be greatly appreciated Thanks Sir can you do a project on healthcare Medical or video in which we follow your guidelines to do a project on it Really enjoyed this series As someone learning the field I loved the practicality of it A video on the best resources for learning the right models to use in which scenarios would be great too ken great video i am little saddnes that i dont understand everything you told Am do you meybe have any feature project from sports area with machine learning concept I am also sports fan and would like to see sometnig with nba or soccer machine learninig concepts hava a nice time Ohh it mean we have to learn flask also to become a data scientist In my case i change three line of code in glassdoor scraper py job buttons driver find elements by class name jl the loop interupter in iterarions for job

series but I decided to do a BONUS one coming out Friday That one will be on writing a solid readme for your projects that will appeal to employers Awesome video dude coool Earlier than I expected Awesome Already told my friend about your vids Thant you for this helpfull tutorial Can you please show us how to scrap tweets of a specific account user because i tried to add a user argument but apperently query tweets has no argument named user Hey Ken I have a question so I ve been following your project step by step to see if I can do it myself and follow along Thanks for that it s great Anyways I can t help but keep doubting myself and thinking I m not good enough like when I get I stick I see what you would do or go to stack and see some answer I could ve never thought of then I wonder how I m ever going to make it in this field and be successful and then I get demotivated and stop studying do you have any tips Maybe something you went through that s similar Thank you TQVM I will have to check out your other videos on DS projects Hi Ken good video as always I was working on this tutorial and the scrap file worked fine yesterday I tried scrapping more data today however the glassdoor scraper py file started to return an error every time I run the data collection py file Perhaps glassdoor made changes on their website I tried cloning your project from Github and it gave the same error Could you look into this Error ElementClickInterceptedException element click intercepted Element li class jl react job listing gdGrid data id data emp id data is organic job true

problems with converting JSON and the code does not skip it it reties and stack at one tweet Can you help with it I think one of the most important lessons of the video is documentation is your best friend Don't fear it befriend it Great video as always Ken Incredible video series Thanks a lot for this info no one did videos projects like this I will follow closely each one and please make more series like this Thanks and already subscribed to the channel I'm doing economics and statistics degree and I'm already self taught software developer I'm good at Python too My question is if I teach myself data science is the this econ stat degree going to help me in the job requirements or they just need data science cert And is it possible the math taught in my class Calculus statistics and linear algebra may cover for the maths required for data science or I need to learn more maths Thanks Hi What text editor do you use for Git Vim I can't give you a like even though I want to It's at likes Thanks a lot for your well detailed videos Massive help Thank you for the Data Science project from scratch videos series Hi Everyone Thanks for watching I have gotten awesome feedback thus far on this series Again my focus here is to show that data science is an iterative process You will constantly find bugs errors and make mistakes You will also have to work through them and seek to understand them I would love to hear about some of the problems errors or bugs you faced that you ended up figuring out in the comments section Really love your approach man So amazing to begin watching you before you began these series and then having this amazing part lesson There is no better teaching than practice and you really just show practice Excellent st viewer i was waiting for it Thanks Subscribed I am using Python for the first time I tried your code but when running the program there is a ValueError Cannot take a larger sample than population when 'replace False' Which should be edited Thank you Hello If I do MS in Data science or Data analytics I will get job in HR analytics or in HR field Good job Hey ken the reason why excel has the same count as aws is because after you did the lamda for excel you didn t replace aws to excel to count followed this through and get an error TypeError get jobs missing required positional arguments 'path' and 'slp time' not clear i have these variables set properly thanks Great video I want to do a project related to financial institution could you please recommend any Great video Ken This is exactly the motivation I needed to continue my data Science journey The lockdown has been a morale killer but your video definitely motivated me to keep learning Thank you Hi Thanks Ken I got some really useful info from your video Hi Ken I am able to retrieve the team and player data and their ID But I just couldn't retrieve the a specific player's data to the variable explorer Plz help Thanks Hi Ken I really like the Video and looking forward to this series One question i want to ask you is that can i add this project to my resume Please reply back to my question Very well structured advice Subscribed and looking forward to more videos Great work man Thanks a lot Great video Thanks Ken Hi Ken Thank you so much for the series and everything you have done so far in this chanel In case of the series Data Science Project from Scratch this is something I was looking for Practical knowladge without cutting with using Google if it's necessary Definitely you helped me a lot to sort my knowledge and add some interesting tips Keep a finger crossed for development of your chanel and if I can say something negative then I would rather to have a possibility to give you more thumbs up D Hey Ken Is it just me that I'm unable to see the salary component on the left aligned job summary columns I'm able to see only Company Name Job Title Location Is the Salary estimate not visible on the updated Glassdoor page I got ' ' as salary estimate for all jobs And this is the same URL from Omer Sakariya's code URL https www glassdoor co in Job san francisco data scientist jobs SRCH IL IC KO htm locKeyword San Francisco CA seniorityType all applicationType locT C remoteWorkType fromAge minRating minSalary cityId employerSizes industryId companyId sc keyword data scientist includeNoSalaryJobs true jobType all radius locId sgocId countryRedirect true From the Part tutorial the salary estimate was available in the short summarized segment of the Glassdoor pages Now the 'Salary' is visible at the different experience levels Trainee Junior Senior roles which becomes tedious to extract and clean Hey Ken I'm a computer science major right now but my school came out with a major masters program where you get a computer science major and data science masters its just one extra year Do you think that's more worth it then a boot camp or cert it's fairly new about k I loved the compelling data storytelling during your exploratory data analysis phase I can't wait for part five Thank you for your effort and value More grace Sir I love data science but I don't really care about sports analytics What other areas or niches could be interesting Please make a video on complete roadmap to become a data scientist I think you may benefit from chopping these into min sections I think that's more digestible for the average viewer and you get more bang for your buck as far as time invested vs content goes Anyways enjoying the content as always Ken Jee upload the video Like video comment on video then watch D i'm from Tunisia in North africa and i'm very interested to learn data sience for sport can you please send me the books that you used to learn betting and sport anaytics this is my email Salemwisal gmail com thank you Hey Everyone I realized that there was so much information here that an EDA could have made for a project itself Please let me know in the comments section if you would be interested in a video where I go through the exact job related findings from the data in this phase awesome content I don't have time to watch all of it right now but I definitely will I am in a data science course right now and the book we use is literally called Data Science from Scratch You're a star This is a great eye opener Hey Ken thank you for this very helpful video Using your code I tried to scrap tweets with ' bitcoin' but only got k tweets for a timeframe of year without a limit defined in the code It seems very few What could the problem be there Awesome video Is this project resume worthy Thank you so much for the knowledge sir Hey Ken The Data Science project series is amazing and much needed Quick question Just like we used 'keyword' for searching with job title what would be the change in code if location too needs a keyword search Great examples I really like the content you are providing but I m wondering how much of the statistics you learned while studying are you applying on a regular basis these have been enormously helpful i've been watching a lot of videos not necessarily acting just yet btw when the weather gets warmer are you going to be wearing tank tops in your vids I'm migrating from a software career to data science I have a few data science projects in my portfolio But still at least a of my projects are pure technical software projects Is it a good idea to list these in my portfolio Because if not I'll be presenting a resume with years of software expeirience with no actual portfolio for that part of my life Does it do any good Or bad Can you give your thoughts Data cleaning process is a very important step and can be very tough at times depending on how messy our dataset is Thanks for the detailed video Ken Just getting into your work Thank you so much learning more from you than I am in class hey Ken Dodji here Thanks for your approach of teaching DS Do you think you can spend some time on how to manage files with github and the flow of working between git hub shell commands and the jupyter notebooks Your series on working on data science projects from scratch is the best by the way Thank you Things every Data science beginner needed Thanks Man Keep it up Hello Ken I am interested in making a project with a deep learning algorithm Could you suggest me a good deep learning algorithm to work on Thanks Edit the project will be for my CV Ken this series is so helpful Keep up the great work and would love to see more videos like this where you take on a DS project and show us the nitty gritty I feel like often times YouTube videos don't show us how much trial and error truly goes into this stuff thanks again That's a lot of books I love reading and this is right up my alley Thanks for the recommendations I really like that you don't edit things out I think the process is much more informational than just the result This is a good mini series man keep it up Loving this series definitely going to take notes on these videos so I have steps and a nice framework to follow when I put together my own data science project Currently trying to build out my portfolio in order to get a job I have been doing some follow along tutorials to familiarize myself with some technologies I would like to learn python pandas scikit learn tensor flow pyspark and then Airflow Eventually I would like to create an end to end project using a combination of these technologies Keep the videos coming man Thanks Awesome info Super straight forward appreciate it man Really great Ken thx Alternate title Part Lots of lambda functions haha Great video Ken really enjoyed the on the spot feature engineering How can i scrape and save say tweets yesterday and resume scraping beyond the point today Awesome vid I'm a DS Major and this is very helpful I can see your channel blowing up when all the software engineers are switching over to DS lol Great advice Part on exploratory data analysis is coming out this Friday If you haven't seen part they are neatly packaged in this playlist https www youtube com watch v MpF HENQjDo list PL zq klxX ASFejJj ob ZAnBHdz O t Would love any feedback on this video and series in the comments section below A wonderful way to present this sometimes confusing topic Thank you Hello sir you have created a very interesting video that I have never seen before And it also help me to grow my own channel DecodeTheCode thank you so much sir Hey Ken enjoyed some of your videos Really enjoy data science have a pretty good background as an IE major Looking to improve my skills One concern I have I got on Kaggle for the first time and I was pretty excited to find these useable data sets to work on some of my data vis skills Saw they were downloadable zip files and that immediately scared me but I naively thought everyone else uses it and a quick google search brought up no safety concerns After downloading about data sets I am pretty convinced i downloaded some malware Got multiple warning signs from the browsers I use and then a bunch of random sites jumped up and teamviewer popped open Immediately shut down and disconnected everything Is this normal Do you have any tips for safely downloading data sets etc Would really appreciate Thanks Hi Ken thanks for making these tutorial videos they are very detailed informative and helpful Thanks for your efforts A quick question In around minutes you use data cylinders pd to numeric data cylinders errors coerce I do not really understand what does this function do can you explain it Thanks Hi Ken i really liked this as it avoids the complication of the API Can you explain what is happening in line df pd DataFrame t dict for t in tweets I know you are converting from the tweet objects to a DataFrame but I don't understand the syntax Thanks Seamus Hello is very good your channel is possible get some remote job of data science or data analisis Can we use web scrapping tool like parsehub for data collection Hello Ken which kind of project do I need to include in my Github Portfolio Thanks For youtube algo thank you for the video one question though say this came up during an interview and I was tasked with making a scraper Would it be OK to say to use someone else's code and provide credit for it look forward to seeing this entire series as I'm currently in my own project building phase for my data scientist career transition This is my first comment on youtube since I am using computer Internet and It's for you Ken You have started such a great super awesome series Data Science Project from Scratch that most of youtubers have'nt and I love it You are such a great man Your Videos are very informative I believe this series will give your channel more and more subscribers Loving this series Really enjoyed this buying ingredients process p There's nothing quite like a video that shows the raw process and is practical Thanks a ton Ken looking forward to the rest of the series especially the data cleaning I 've been learning a lot thru courses and I've learned cleaning data python numpy pandas matplotlib and a few others but the math and algorithms are difficult I haven't done math in school since I for sure feel like I'm in the seconds phase of learning Should I stop learning the python programming part and just focus more on the math part I would think that a database containing the relevant data would exist and then we could see some SQL action This video helped a bunch I m a high school senior who is torn between my major for next year I m deciding between music and sports business marketing I m pretty well versed with how the sports world works due to just falling in love with sports in general Is there any chance I could get your email I would love to be able to chat about this field Hi Ken Is it possible to use ipad when doing data science Thank you your videos has the best timing thank you for the useful tips i m currently at stage and using your tips to transition forward a big thanks Ken I'll start by giving back TO SELECT PAGES OF TEXT EASILY just select a small portion of the beginning of whatever paragraph it is and then scroll to the last point you want and then hold shift and hover over the point so your cursor turns to the I beam and click whilst holding shift It will select the entire body That said Thanks so much man I am currently on my journey to becoming a Data Scientist and I love it I just love it I also prefer Spyder over Jupyter and seeing all this is exactly what I needed to know I wondered how people get datasets from online and stuff I will be following closely on the series best believe how long did it take u to make ur own website Hey Everyone I hope you enjoyed the video Stay tuned for Part Data Cleaning that will be coming out on Wednesday I am loving the questions and comments so far so please keep them coming I loved the video Happy that I have found your announcement on reddit looking forward for the next episode Amazing series very well structured Can't wait to see more Do you prefer to learn data science in R or python Very informative video can t wait for part Great work flow example Keep up the good work Great video thanks again I'm curious you found pre existing code and made edits to it as you went along How often is this the case for you on the job or for any other data scientist How prepared should one be to make their own data scraper Is that something that we will bump into a lot in the future Yes Story telling is under appreciated It's not even really taught Dope screen Finally D I wonder why u had to use a CSV file of G size Really Thanks Jen i am national lawn tennis player and want to be a data scientist the moment I saw you writing tennis I hit the like button this is the perfect one for me to startup with Thanks man I really aprreciate the video Am havign error with matplotlib I have it installed already but it not showing the graph and saying no module named matplotlib pyplot please help Please do something on soccer Looking forward to part This is a great video Thank you Thank you so much for sharing these books I really appreciated how you share information with people nice I am working on my first proper project would like to see how pros go about it This is real helpful Thanks for the video I m excited to see the more discord only respond with a date hahaha Finally Thank you Ken You're channel is great You deserve more followers Hello Ken thanks for the videos Ive learned a lot from you Can you please make a video about Application for a Job as a Data Scientist CV and how to structure my Github in case the company wanna have a look on it It would be so helpful because Im quit good in Python but still didn't found a job Thank you again I'm so excited for this series Wow bro what a great explanation from you Bro can you please list some great possible data science projects that I should take into consideration and work on Thanks a lot Good work keep rocking i hope this will help me on my final project waiting for the next video Keep it up thanks for the great content Thanks man Eagerly waiting to end the whole project with you My first DS project Hi Ken I'm glad I stumbled upon your channel Looking forward to see more of your upcoming videos Project videos are a great idea keep it up Another great video Showing us how to think and plan rather than just spitting out explicit answers Excited for the future installments Thank you for this addition I think I want to start with linear regression on premier league soccer and predicting final league standing from early season information Men I was waiting for this Thank you very much Instagram Human mimic AI bot Using autoencoders to mimmic human behavior I am happy to hold you guys accountable on your projects Leave some of your ideas in the section below to make sure that you will do them Also make sure to subscribe and turn on notifications to be alerted when part comes out on Monday Can we get followers and the people we follow by using this Or is there any other way for it Very good content I'm taking a Data Science bachelor in a University in Portugal Do you think it has a bright future We learn Python R SQL AI Statistics Machine Learning techniques and in our Senior year we have to do an research project and develop a project for a companie You have the link here if you to check it out https www iscte iul pt course bachelor bsc in data science Keep with the great work and I hope you do well with this channel a lot of great content about DS here Good content Can you do a video on ARIMA in Python and going through in details the ADF test forecasting train test Hope you are fine now Thank you very much for this free invaluable content Hey Everyone It looks like the free data science courses offer has expired The rest of the resource that I mentioned in this video are free though https www youtube com watch v Ip cXvpWY thanks for such wonderful word Ken But the link you shared above is redirecting to Udemy and are not free If I were to want to get a job in this field would it be enough to learn these free courses and the information and to relay what I have learned to the hiring manager Or would I need to get some sort of certification Thanks Hi Ken Edoardo Brizi here We've spoken on LinkedIn and as I told you I'm one of your newer subscribers I've been binge watching your videos since we've chatted and I wanted to give you props for the content you have on your channel Very instructive and insightful Best E B Thank you very much for useful piece of advise Really appreciate for giving so much knowledge about Data Science and its application in real life Bro I just need one help from you Bro can you please provide me list of only those US and UK universities that have great reputation only in Data Science program Currently I don't care about other programs Actually I am looking forward to do my Msc in Data Science And since its an healthy and valuable field therefore I want to do from that university which has good reputation and standing in this program Please if its possible and if you have some idea then provide me list of US and UK universities that are best for Data Science and very much worth for pursuing this degree Thanks a lot Hi Ken Thanks for the video I come from a humanties background and as of now don't exactly know what kind of position I want after a MSc in Data Science and Business Analytics but I think the skills can be applied to a wide range of sectors and industries and I can explore more during grad school In a nutshell I do want to gain these skills and open more doors in the future do you think this is a less mature thought through motivation to pursue such a degree Great stuff just started using Matplotlib today Man that s confusing Your content is so underrated Another great video Ken Could you do a beginner project from start to finish video Maybe include a part two to it where you show how to display the data using Tableau Mario Hi Sir just wanted to ask that if how do I present my interactive charts online GREAT VIDEO U Hi Ken Thank you for your advice This has been very helpful as an aspiring data scientist I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on this project I am currently working on and if it is good enough to put on my portfolio To quickly summarize I did EDA on my Spotify listening history and merged it with a Spotify features dataset that listed features of each song For example tempo major acousticness and valence are a couple examples I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the songs I usually listen to and the features However there was very little correlation so I said that the model using multiple linear regression I would build would be very inaccurate at predicting and showed the inaccuracy by building it and finding its mean squared error which was very large although there were some predictions that were close In your opinion would this suffice as a good project If not do you have any insight on how I could improve Thank you for all your videos Can you please suggest some tutorials for learning deployment of Machine learning models Great advice bro had to give it a like and subscribed Thanks for this video I hope you could make more videos like this It could be helpful also for you to understand it more Thank you so much Hey is jupyter notebook too slow to run Everytime I login again after a break I have to rerun all the cells and still notice some of the cells are unexecuted it's like running a same codes for many a times before you move ahead it's so frustrating is their a way to handle all this your videos are amazing Awesome Thanks a ton for this video Ken I recently dropped out of my physics PhD after going through some hard times financially and after falling in love with data science Your videos are absolutely invaluable to me and I'm very appreciative of the work you put into them I don't feel so bad now spending half the time I devote each day to acquiring data analyst science skills in learning math linear algebra statistics and probability and calculus A live stream video reviewing resumes or projects would be highly valuable Now back to practicing multiplying matrices I go I will do as you suggest and watch those videos before asking you if you downt have it already maybe some playlist would be a good idea My recommended order of watching See these before asking me questions I would at least like it I plan on watching all of the videos but with the corona situation closed kindergartens and schools I m trying to learn statistical analysis while having small kids home so it may take some time Anyway you have already given me the most clear information on what a data scientist actually do and I only have a little more than a year left of my bachelor s So thank you Awesome this is a very good concept to share and you are right most people watching this are self directed Thanks for sharing Ken Jee hello ken i am pursuing masters degree in data science and planned to graduate in August I am now worried about job market due the present situation How bad it would be impacted in terms of data science job market and economy Is there any crisis we are facing Please make a video if possible Good book suggestion and the time to publicise its values I finished Young's book at the end of last year and it really helped me be a more attentive learner I utilised a Trello board to track down the list of resources following the meta learning principle Fully agree with you on the other parts as well like directness and feedback I found that to be the keystone habit for me in last few months as I always regurgitate information to the point where I can explain concepts like JOINs LEFT JOINs without having to refer repeatedly to other resources Thanks Ken Nice man I've been trying to get a copy of Ultralearning but Amazon's all backed up on shipping because of the situation yes Another quality video Ken I love non fiction books so this review a book and apply it to data science type of style is right up my alley I think it brings in a lot more video ideas too I started my data science course work based on your suggestions thanks Ken Great video I would love to see you do live streams and engage with your audience Your channel is small enough to talk to your audience but should take advantage of that before it goes big Good job thanks for the video If you would be interested in me doing a live stream where I review resumes or projects please let me know in the comments below Ultralearning Book t Keep going pro Thank you Ken I m taking up algorithms from scratch right now just the basics and you often mention that data science is about using the best way to solve the task This kinda scares me Are there in reality effective and reliable ways to make sure that the algorithm and solution for a task were chosen correctly Should I be less scared by this I ve just started learning and for me this seems that experimenting can be endless Would be cool if you break or confirm this fear thank you again I love your videos Videos where you review someone's projects and CV would definitely be valuable Keep up the good work Hey Ken Great video Right now I m in the beginning phase I am enrolled in Johns Hopkins course for data science due to employment benefits and it s free Since Hopkins is biostatistics and clinical research based the course is taught in R I am learning because I want a job in data science but not exclusively in biostatistics I also prefer Python over R My question is should I enroll in another course that is Python based and focus on that for a more generalized approach or should I just stick with the Hopkins course Thank you I like your style Ken You're not pretentious with your information Please keep it up You're an asset to the community HI Ken Great Video I have a question about the project Any recommend project to build for portfolio I have done couple real estate analysis and recommendation project I want to explore more on the machine learning part during this break Hey Ken This definitely is a great tutorial but I'm also a beginner as well just like the others Could you possibly do some simple beginner projects from start to finish using the Spyder IDE Definitely have the time on my hands now due to the corona virus and i feel that would be a big help to me and the other beginners out there Ken Jee Thank you for this tutorial But when I try to scraping a data it's not giving me only a couple of tweets even thou I'm sure the tags I used having more than thousand of tweets any help Also is Arabic is considered in this model Many thanks Hey Ken what tools should I have on my laptop to use for python data science projects Do you use an IDE Hey Ken Great video I m actually improving my python skills during this time FYI you got some good Towards Data Science articles I really like your structured video content and explanation thanks and keep making videos This was immensely helpful thanks for putting in the time to make this vid The only constant in data science is that it's always changing It's important to always learn new technologies Thanks Ken for the motivation You spent almost half of your presentation talking about Machine learning feature engineering clustering regression etc In my humble opinion Data science has a lot to do with other aspects other than Machine learning I realized many people focus a lot on machine learning which shrinks a lot of the aspects of data science Kaggle for example encourages folks to hone their machine learning skills Kaggle isn't a good place to learn full fledge data science skills Data collection Data Cleaning Data manipulation Exploratory Data analyses where all left out Kaggle mostly brings ready made datasets which limits many kagglers the ability to effectively develop their data science skills Nevertheless I sincerely appreciate the value you have provided through your video Thank you Sir Ken what IDE are you using Seems better than Jupyter Great video as always but I will say this is a serious understatement Now that I'm out of work I am ever so glad that I have decided to pursue this career path Three great reasons to pursue data science Do something positive for society and gain a strong sense of purpose Something to keep the mind stimulated which can greatly help with depression and anxiety A solid career that can potentially help someone avoid being homeless and going down a dark path I think these are solid enough reasons to purse this field Hi Ken loved this video Could you do a Clustering one Stay safe In general python and R are very similar in my opinion Thanks for finding the positives during this time of uncertainty still no discord it s okay i ll keep waiting haha Keep going Ken I was impressed by your NBA project though Thanks Ken just found your channel Was an engineer in college but drifted towards fitness and nutrition coaching as my career went on Industry is rocked right now so I'm learning some Data Science on the side and your videos are helping Great video When you say you expect the work culture to shift towards employees working from home do you mean in the short term i e while the pandemic is still going on or do you see this just being the new working environment Interesting insight Can you suggest a good youtube channel or website for learning a good amount of python for data science Thankyou ken Whenever I see that Ken Jee notification I drop everything I'm doing to watch it Couldn't agree more Working on a data set about the virus during this time So many people have created really insightful notebooks on Kaggle already I ve been learning a lot using my iPhone and I ve gotten to that stage above the usage of a phone kind of difficult getting a laptop but hopefully someday I ll be able get one to practice with Thanks for your motivations Sooooo true No one is realizing that without data scientists right now millions more would die They need people to work through statistics on illnesses especially COVID Good video Great video I m starting a statistical analysis course tomorrow morning I had discrete math and algorithms and data structures last year so I have been looking forward to this course I was thinking about doing math courses in my electives next year pure mathematics for programmers and further discrete mathematics Hi Ken this video help me a lot but there's an error that I get said Traceback most recent call last and there's a lot of error message down below anyway to fix it Thankyou Ken Love from India Hi Ken You doing an Awesome job my making all this quality informative videos I wanted to discuss something with you so is there any way i can shoot you an email I will really appreciate that Regards Thank you very much for your clarification regarding Data science projects I just want to ask one question from you What is the starting salary of data scientist per month Thanks Thanks for sharing Cool can anyone tell the chrome extention I have been looking similar kind of project to recognise company logo s Thank you It will help me build my own project are you Asian hybrid no offense just kidding I absolutely love this Finally something specific to learn from Do more do more Have you ever tried the intel Movidius neural compete stick btw And another question Are you skilled with NoSQL I just had a term paper using Cassandra MongoDB and Neo j I got an on it I could almost cry I put everything into that Used x the time estimation I might actually complain about the grade But I have the same professor In courses next year it might not be smart Anyway Keep doing ones like this They will get me trough the courses Very interesting video Ken Thanks a lot One question regarding Google Colab though Do you use the TPU setup or the GPU setup I've been told that TPU performance is a lot better than GPU's and I was curious what you actually use Also I recently got into Work From Home setup and it seems to me that you have a very minimalist style setup where you can focus on your work efficiently Would you be willing to share your setup if you don't mind in your future video Hoping you are staying safe as well Hi I am new to Python and am trying to set up the data and code in the program How do i get the data over and start to work on the team stats Thank you for this project How hard do you think it ll be getting a job now With all the corona stuff happening Do you think it s the same probability of getting a job but I just have to work harder and be better Like same probability higher standards I love this You should make more like these but start with simple basic end to end projects and progressively make it harder Great content Looking forward to more projects Thank you so much Hello from Norway Finally I found a channel that actually tells me something concrete about data science I m doing my second year of a data science bachelor and looking for an idea for a thesis project Any ideas would be much appreciated Do you live in Chciago I swear you were walking on Wabash by Roosevelt University What about getting a bachelors in data science Should I do anything after it or go for jobs right away Hello Ken Jee would you be able to help I get this error while running the code below The error comes out as part of the output But the number of tweets seems less even without me setting a limit ERROR Failed to parse JSON Expecting value line column char while requesting https twitter com i search timeline f tweets vertical default include available features include entities reset error state false src typd max position TWEET q coronavirus since A until A l en Another Great video As soon as I saw that there are no ads I subscribed Sir I am years old And I am interested in the field of data science because I am interested technical things Sir any tip for me Hello Can you show me how to get boxscore and andvase state from single games I just dont understand the best this endpoint section in nba api You are best Ken I appreciate the video source code This is very helpful thank you is it possible to restrict the tweets to location Hello Ken I'm a beginner and need some help Whenever I run code on my Console A window on the bottom right of the Spyder IDE it doesn't show the output of the code Instead it spits out runcell 'file path location of current file code is being type in' For example if I type in a like you did and try to run it this is what I get for the output on the console ln runcell 'C Users James spyder py temp py' How do I fix this so I can see the output of my code This is mainly annoying because I can't even see the first few rows of the dataframe when you called head because this is the output I keep getting help Helpful as always good to see you back You are awesome Please be safe In really interested in sports analytics or data science as a field I am only in high school so what majors would be good to pursue this kind of job Would you suggest something like statistics or computer science Please guide me for masters in CS with a concentration in ML and artificial intelligence I did my undergraduate in economics Another great video Out of curiosity how did you make the time to read one book per week Hey Jee prop to you I love using google colab Though sometimes it gets me scratching my head because they are things you have to do google way Like imshow that I have to spend all day to figure it out My only concern using colab is that privacy with google Some of my data that I would like to use for practice are work related So I am not sure if it s private enough What s your take Hi Ken fantastic video thanks Instead of saving it as a Panda's df can the tweets be saved as a CSV file Thanks for giving us very useful and informative advice Just wanna ask if its possible to show us the sample of resume involving data science part or if possible then can you show your resume involving data science part if its not personal and private Thanks Same like as this channel if you any one of you want to do data science projects and M L and A I projects please refer to this M I T student channel and i am not promoting But those who are interested get to this data science Channel for projects and about latest technologies Data science project video link https www youtube com watch v YkZdXWdG RU https www youtube com watch v pYb AUVuJ i really appreciate You talk and share your experience very smoothly i am trying House price Advance Regression problem since three months even though i applied feature selection algorithms libraries sklearn regression models but didn't work i am stuck I need help Great video Ken Suggestion for a future video Data Science and the Coronavirus As always great video One idea I haven't heard of before is focusing on one project and learning only the specific skills necessary for that project Everyone's experienced the overwhelm when it comes to beginning the Data Science ML DL journey and we're usually hit with the learn all of statistics all of programming and all of math mentality that is drilled into our heads This can be enough to scare people away and your advice really combats this while touching on the idea of running on passion and things you enjoy by picking a personal project or use case It's really cool to see that you have a specific domain that you stay in for projects sports and sports betting My question is Do you stay within that domain at work If you do do you suggest that we each choose a specific domain as well and cater towards that when building a career and finding a job If you don't would you agree that it's still valuable to choose a specific domain Do you think that your experience and expertise in sports sports betting transfers over to your current job position Thanks for the video Ken I think that what worked for me can definitely work for you in this case You need to be patient and consistent when learning this field Feel free to comment any questions that you may have below In your opinion is a statistics' degree useful to become a data scientist or is completely useless What about adding a point line a little bit closer to the basket than the current point line feet closer that would give a boost to the no man's land and the now reluctantly taken and often frowned upon mid range jumper And then moving the point line a bit further away I think this could eventually make the game more interesting It only takes a bid getting used to points and if you are fouled while attempting a point shot the first time team gets free throws next time this happens free throws are rewarded It might be worth a try Haven't read that elsewhere as of yet I m in the second stage forsure I hate it it demotivated me haven t been working as hard because every time I get stuck I see the answer that I could never have though of with functions idek how they got and I m like I ve been on this problem for an hour It s like macro patience and micro results It is a big honor to get such information from you thank you so much yes python is better in many ways espetially for programming issues but for data wrangling dplyr etc data analisys visualisation ggplot and modelling there is nothing what comes close to tidyverse I tried to transition to python in the academia and it was just painful cheers How did I miss this upload Keep up the good work For iPhone users you can download Carnets from AppStore its GUI is exactly like that of Jupyter Notebook Hi there Mr Ken Great content Anyway I don t have any computer science IT or math background but want to be a data scientist I will be years old two months from now Is there any hope for me How long will it take for me to learn data science Thank you so much your reply will be appreciated this video was really helpful and put my mind at ease really practical and clear instructions thank you Ken keep up the good work This was a surprisingly good video Ken I think that IBM Cognitive Classes are really good as a starting point How a out datacamp I subscribed a month but have not started yet data science have udemy courses and their website plans l just bought their udemy courses on sale do you know what rhe fundamental difference is Data science sports analytics subscribed I have enrolled courses on Coursera Is it okay to go through them because most of courses on Coursera are basic I use DataQuest it s free to start and see if you like it then it s like a month i didn t like DataCamp because it was video based What do you think about Udemy's Data Sciense courses Ken Wow this is actually very very helpful Thanks Ken Keep making videos Nice clear video on the data hierarchy of needs Great job SSLError HTTPSConnectionPool host 'free proxy list net' port Max retries exceeded with url Caused by SSLError SSLError bad handshake SysCallError 'WSAECONNRESET' I'm getting this error What should I do What are the wireless headphones your using Can you please suggest me how an Economics graduate become a data analyst or data scientist Very good video i like it Glad I found your channel Pretty much gave me a roadmap for getting into the field I m an analyst now but would definitely like to do sports data science Seems like a dream job I watch your videos regularly Why dont you make a video of making a project from scratch for the beginners I want to ask unrelated question do you still programming coding when working as a data scientist Or just focusing more on statistic Great video I love your consistency in producing valuable videos with relevant topics Cheers I like your content a lot my comment is can you make your speech less scripted Or it is just ur style of doing it idk anyway good job Just got my master's degree in business analytics and your videos inspired me a lot I hope I can watch your video before I applied for this program My program was a two year program covered R tableau JMP Excel supply chain and SQL But I have not landed a job yet To finish my program as soon as I can I took summer sessions and didn't find an intern After graduation Some people say students with CS background is stronger and suggest me to start to learn python or java Some say SAS certificates would help me get a job easily What's your opinion about my situation Thank you Ken Help needed i don't understand this how data is displaying in console area what have you done after selecting code please help as i am new to this field TIA Awesome this is happening to me with my actual clients THANKS Hey Ken I love the video Just wondering how I can filter by user when I add user user into the query it returns query tweets got an unexpected keyword argument 'user' Thanks again EDIT I did scroll down here and find the correct code for filtering by username Is it not possible to add in the date keywords filters along with a username For instance all coronavirus news from nytimes over the last days Thank you so much again Are there basic skills interests or talents you possessed that kind of lead you to say yeah I want to make a leap into programming analytics data science I ask because there are so many people out there including myself that are interested in sports analytics and fascinated by it but I'm not certain I could actually contribute to the field or am a good fit for it if that makes sense I'm currently Junior and Advertising major in college and would appreciate any advice you could pass along Thank you another good analysis would be a batters Hitting average home vs away There's theory that some teams were doing the same thing for home games The batters with a much greater batting average at home vs away can be telling Hi congrats for this video Do you know some books about soccer analytics Thanks Great video men You are putting out the real managerial level stuff just a question Is there any literature you know where we can validate the pyramid you showed Thank you for all these insights and videos you are doing about data science I really love your videos very clear and easy to understand It's a crime that this channel is not more popular Can someone tell me the background music plz Since you can integrate data science in business can you make data science a business Like an AI company Or is that not data science Thank you I remember I asked you to do this video I hope that it would help many and become one of the most viewed videos on your channel Do I need to practice leetcode for data science interviews Or is it ok to know only statistics mathematics Python's data science libraries and Kaggle contests but no interview coding questions the ones related to datastrucrures and algorithms Good video that was interesting thanks Hey Ken great video Went through your linkedin profile and found that you've done your masters from Depaul University I have been working as a Data Analyst for the past two years and was thinking of pursuing a graduate degree in the same university Some questions How do you rate the Ms in CS with Machine learning electives as compared to the Ms in Data Science program at Depaul university And what course do you suggest if I plan on being a data scientist years down the line I concur Nice tips Great tips Super useful Thanks Hi Ken thanks for the tutorial It really worked However after I tried to get a large amount of data I think the limit I entered was the console says that it encountered an error involving json file May I know how could I avoid this error Thanks I don't agree with some of these points I think if you are the expert of your company then you need to jump into bigger challenges Nothing worth solving is done by person you usually work in a team of data scientists data engineer machine learning engineers so ask for help when needed don't over do it obviously but PLEASE don't have an ego unless you are Ian Goodfellow and he seems very humble so please don't have an ego So I ve been binge watching many of your videos there s not a lot of DS resources to begin with so first I wanna say thank u for putting stuff out there to help me It s like you re my mentor I have questions Should I get a MS before getting a job or while I m working I m a recent math major graduate was planning to go to med school but then I wanted to do something in my field math and I learned about data science and I instantly knew I m doing DataQuest data science path Do i even need a MS Can you do a review of DataQuest How much should I study a day I ve been studying hours a day after I finish my full time dead end job just so I can get into a company I want and start being a data scientist Rn I m a beginner just started in Feb learned python OOP NumPy and Pandas and now I m doing data aggregation and cleaning Anyways where can I practice I feel like Kaggle is advanced for me and I feel like cheating if I don t know how to do something and I look it up How high level of coding do you use How to change spyder to dark theme I actually just found out that the by inning at bat data exists I will hopefully be adding a part to this video with that analysis Ken Any data by individual batter How do we know if the stolen sign was correct Since a batter only has a second or so to react to a pitch thrown what if some batters might do better if they didn't believe they knew the sign and therefore might overthink the at bat So far you won't be able to answer these questions However can you split the sample by runners on base vs no runners on base btw I still need to respond to the info you sent regarding point conversion Thx for that For those wanting more specifics on the Linear and logistic regressions For both models the p value of bangs was not significant For the linear regression the R Square was Thanks for watching and remember to comment with your thoughts on this scandal Ken I thought you said I got a B in calculus then relistened and heard you said D D I was already judging you 'P Hi Ken loving the channel I m likely going to try and push into data science once my PhD is complete and I was wondering how big should a project be to make it worthy of going on a resume I imagine something written in a few hours wouldn t be worthy but where exactly this line falls I m not so sure I did a sentiment analysis where I compared several models and logistic regression performed the best I then scraped my own data from twitter for a predictive analysis Damn I switched majors a bunch of times too and decided to go wth economics because I felt like it was challenging enough to keep me focused NOW I m in my last semester and about to apply to a graduate program for data science to become a data scientist that will hopefully work in sports Hey ken cheers for another detailed video I recently finished my first side data analysis project and have added it to a github to show on my resume What next steps do you suggest for me Is there any way to get my project reviewed for any feedback Thanks Hello Ken I started studying Data Science last year and since them your channel helped me a lot with a lot of tips and advices Please continue with your fantastic work Great refresher Been binge watching a lot of your videos to resume my studying of data science hi Ken if i already use R should I learn python or continue with R When did you sleep not mention what maths are needed for sports analytics moneyball Thanks I've learned a lot from your channel Could you post something about the case study in DS interview some non technical part I feel like it's also important for data scientists Very informative thank you No doubt about communicating with professors to get an experience I was able to get a machine learning research position as an undergrad at one of my CS professors' lab Also other pieces of advice are priceless Thank you Ken Main Project Topics Regression Classification Clustering Deep Learning Interesting video I'm a Junior Undergrad majoring in CS and I love Data Science videos like yours Thanks the frustration is real thanks for the encouragement most times I feel like tossing my computer into the wall i don't though too expensive Awesome video This really helped as I am a undergrad physics data science major I requested to connect w you on linkedin too Nice piece of advice Ken Good job Titanic is very good project for EDA Thanks for this video Ken I have a sports analytics problem for you When the point shot was first introduced in the NBA I said start launching them Traditionalists said oh no too risky too many will ruin the game years later point shots are an integral part of any teams' strategy OK my question is regarding the point conversion in football My belief is that the point conversion should be tried every time Once a team gets used to it they will develop special teams just for the conversion Plus once fully developed these plays could be used for any regular down inside the yard line The amount of dedicated plays could be unlimited QB's on the field running backs non traditional formations etc Not to mention how exciting the game would become Do you have any supporting evidence that over time going for the point conversion of the time would pay off I guess part of your problem is that you cannot measure what hasn't been tried Hello Ken I need to contact you personally Any ideas on How I could begin choosing a topic for my Honours Postgraduate research thesis this year It is in Data Science for business decision support I don't have any computer science background but I really would something interesting in this area because it is quite a broad area This is very helpful Thanks Thank you for this video I have a nice video suggestion How to implement Data Science into a working business Let's imagine you have a business that produces refrigerators One single small factory a sales team etc I know that Data Science can help make any process more efficient let it be the energy consumption the production itself supply chain sales marketing etc What could one do to implement data collection and data analysis in a company like this to analyze data and drive insights to make a business more efficient What are some real life examples software names etc What is your related real life experience I don't ask for a whole sophisticated tutorial the basic overview kind of information would be enough so a person from a non technical background could learn how to implement Data Science in business Thanks a lot I am your devoted fan There are many channels out there but they don't cover Data Science as broadly as you are You deserve many more views I believe you will get them I am curious as to your opinion on these month bootcamps that claim to have a job guarantee and claim that people get data science roles versus an month masters program I find it hard to believe a month bootcamp would outweigh a two year program one thing which makes me really enjoy your content is how each video gets straight to the point and that its summarised in the description Thanks Ken Jee Thank you Ken I am now a business student in UK inspired by your twitter scraper video I decide to apply business analysis for master degree Hi Ken I want to pursue career in Data Science and I'm struggling with it Though I'm in final year of undergraduate degree in computer science but I haven't worked on real projects I really have this passion and feel that I can do work but Argh I find myself stuck every single time Despite the fact that people appreciate me for 'Learning new things without hesitation' but I do not progress I have been using online free resources about data analysis machine learning for about two months but I couldn't progress from regression and classification When I learn I deeply grasp a concept and I've discussed this thing with my professor many times but I didn't get satisfactory answer Am I missing something doing wrong Or is it just I worry too much Hi What internship salary someone like you could ask for I don't want to be fooled by an employer and I don't want to ask too much Your videos help so much Currently an undergrad physics data science major hoping to pursue computational astrophysics and to use ML Hey ken I am and I am really interested in learning data science and pursue it as my career Any tips for me Hi Ken very informative video Would a general MS in Analytics be equivalent to a MS in Data Science Or would employers prefer someone with a MS in Predictive Analytics versus someone with a MS in Analytics Thanks Ken Definitely a very underrated channel Very informative and insightful I have an error that appearance SSL error SSLError HTTPSConnectionPool host 'free proxy list net' port Max retries exceeded with url Caused by SSLError SSLError bad handshake SysCallError 'WSAECONNRESET' what is the solution for that eeror help Are these applied to data science internships as well How do you develop your skills in calculus I never took calculus in high school and I'm barely in my first year of college excuse me

step i'm starting to get timeout errors like the one below ReadTimeout HTTPSConnectionPool host 'stats nba com' port Read timed out read timeout when trying the playergamelog endpoint Have you encountered something like that before Thanks Ken hallo can u help me how to convert the result to csv thanks before ur video so amazing Thank you so much man Love the analogy Ken everyone can relate to it Will give it a try can you meybe show us how to get comments of youtube video to anaconda enviroment like pandas and jupyter notoebook As a Data Scientist myself I totally I agree with everything you just said Hi Ken don't you think Data Scientists are limited to the quality extent of the Dataset they have access to underrated channel Love it Hey Ken im from Brazil and I im doing a udacity program for data analyst What path do you recommend for me to become a data scientist since step And if you have time i cant find anywhere make a v deo doing a model basically what a data scientist does but actually doing it Thanks for the content you are really good keep going unexpected but interesting comparison i definitely agree with you on the feature engineering portion Great analogy Ken Ken the point shot means that defenses can no longer help against offensive ball penetration because point shooters have become so expert and are stationed too far away from the basket With the increase in dribbling ability along with an increase in athleticism to convert alley oop dunks so easily even the n game has become impossible to stop Basketball's offensive defensive balance has been totally ruined Defenses can neither take away the point or point game in today's NBA as the rules are currently set up When there was only a point basket defenses could help on ball penetration and know that a distance shot would not destroy their ability to compete in the game Moving the point basket out further only exacerbates this problem by creating more space that a defense has to cover after positioning its resources to defend the point game If the defense chooses to shut down the point shooters by staying with them then the defense is decimated with the point game The NBA has a structural problem that data analytics cannot fix can we search the tweets query for more than sentence like in the video you just use 'notre dame fire' how if I want to search 'notre dame fire' and ' notre' is that possible Hi Ken do you recommend that data scientists should learn how to webscrape like using Beautifulsoup I know pandas has a read html function that lets you extract lists from websites so I was contemplating on learning beautifulsoup Great video very interesting topic i've been trying to do some analysis in fights and it's very interesting to see a more broad perspective about other sports keep it up you have great content Sir please suggest best online course for data science Dude seriously Don't do videos outside in the wind Wtf I have a csv which contains tweet id s I need tweets related to the id Any help is appreciated good stuff prowling your page for some walk throughs too Hi ken I got an error after run the code raise SSLError e request request SSLError HTTPSConnectionPool host 'free proxy list net' port Max retries exceeded with url Caused by SSLError SSLError bad handshake SysCallError 'WSAECONNRESET' how can i fix it Are sports analytics projects ok as personal projects when applying to a different industry I really like it but I'm not sure if it will be looked down upon Love your vids Dude this is the clearest video I've seen so far Kudos Hi ken great video but I got an error AttributeError 'Tweet' object has no attribute ' dict ' Another awesome video Ken Golf has been a big part of my life and now I m in a data science bootcamp so this video was very interesting Thanks for the perspective you should start a data science discord server This is very interesting Ken Hi Ken thank you for the video I have a problem with this instruction begin date dt date python version does not support this syntax Hi Ken great video I recently finished my Master s in Applied Analytics but the Data Science learning journey is never over I really appreciate your insight and perspective on the field of Data Science and Sports Analytics Keep up the great work Hey ken thank you so much for the video Would you be able to do another video on incorporating other parameters to pull all player for the last games with per game averages instead of the totals Dude You're amazing Whenever I sidetrack myself from learning Data Science Your videos really help me there in keeping me interested and intact to proceed to learn more about it Love your content Ken I'm struggling beginner with the first lines of code How do I make the lines appear in the Console A and execute them Hi Ken I tried following your tutorial but when I try to run everything I get a long error message in the console Being a novice the answers on boards liek GitHub and Stackoverflow are more confusiing than anything else Do you happen to know what the nature of this error is Thank you for your help Here is the error I get File

'SSL routines' 'tls process server certificate' 'certificate verify failed' I had to stop the video and try this out myself I went back and found this clip in moneyball Just ran all the numbers for the MLB season This is wild My hometown team the TB Rays with runs and against with projected wins ended up with Got to win the close games nd largest difference behind Chi White sox who had a winning percentage despite having for and against This is so cool and I really appreciate that you take the time to upload content like this Thank you so much for mapping out your path I am curious to know what your thoughts are regarding health informatics and how feasible it would be for an informatics specialist to transition into data science Why you r not popular Underrated Thank you so much for putting this content out It's an invaluable resource for someone like myself who is in the process of applying to grad school I was wondering if you think the pros and cons of a masters degree outlined in the video would apply to a masters in statistics as well I'm currently working in a completely unrelated field and I'm applying to mostly stats programs but a few data science as well Any insight would be greatly appreciated Your channel is what I've been looking for at a long time really appreciate these Fundamentals series hey ken jee i m getting problem ImportError cannot import name 'query tweets' from 'twitterscraper' D Anacondaprojects twitterscraper py would you help me with that please and tell me how to install tweepy for spyder it says you dont have ssl tsl Hello Ken Thank for your video BIG HELP I wanna do a project of shoot chart do you know which packages that can help me quickly get the player's shooting data like located X or located Y hello Ken Can you please describe broadly about advanced feature engineering Ken thank you for such an informative video When you mentioned live coding interview tests does that only include leetcode questions or could we also expect kaggle like questions From my experience kaggle like questions are usually take home assignments but I've not heard yet whether companies ask us to live code on Google doc using Pandas or something alike I have Bank data contains customer Demographics including Account Type and Bank Balances I want to know which customer to Target for Financing the bank products like Insurance Autos etc My biggest problem is communication I'm very bad at communicating I got an error No module names twitterscraper Great to watch Good video What are your thoughts on just having a CS undergrad degree Can one do well with employers with just the undergrad experience Great video as always Just as a suggestion I would be very interested in seeing good techniques layouts for building an impressive portfolio to showcase to employers Please keep the Data Science Fundamentals Series going it's really helpful Which book to use if I want to study soccer I want to work on this topic can you help me Hey Ken great video I was wondering if you ever had any onsite modeling interviews I have one coming up in weeks and the time limit is hrs Would it be similar to a takehome assignment Thanks in advance Ken please make tutorials video on specific Data Science projects it would be helpful Hi Ken thanks for another insightful video I have my BA in applied mathematics and have been studying programming and machine learning in python for months now I prefer self studying over schooling because I feel like I learn best that way One problem I'm currently facing is that a lot of entry level and internship level Data Science Analyst job postings require either a PHD or a Masters degree Should I keep putting my focus on my coding projects for my online profile for employers to see Hello Ken I love your videos I have a question How I can know if I am ready for applying to internships or not I have done few online courses on data science and worked on some projects during the course but still I have low confidence which always stops me from applying to internships why would you apply tolower again Wasn't it already done for the whole data frame what's the use of doing data cylinders data Great video Ken and I really enjoy your channel At around mark you said you probably wouldn't recommend betting on sports in the first place Would you mind elaborating on that and explain why you wouldn't Keep making these good informative videos Thanks great insight As an undergraduate data science major I've worried about not being able to land a data science position immediately after graduation A lot of companies still seem to require a masters degree or at least yrs of experience for data science roles I wanna carefully anticipate that these requirements would change within a couple of years to where undergraduate students are welcomed to apply as I believe data science field is growing rapidly Can you talk about how you got your experience into data science and what you think about people coming from a Data Analyst role Hey Ken these videos are really great It's nice that I'm able to follow almost everything you're doing already One question is I know these videos are Fundamentals of Data Science but how much farther does your day to day Data Science job go from here That last part of your video was top tier For my capstone project in college I had did a semester long data science project that had a ton of different parts We collected our own data cleaned it and created new features out of existing ones We didn t have enough time to create a website or proper interface to interact with our results but putting in that extra work is really what made the project stand out This was cool to watch I graduated months ago with a BS in physics and very little programming experience I put in a stupid number of hours learning Python and now I just started a remote part time DS DA position with a cycling start up Still a lot to learn but looking forward Did they teach you how to use python in school or did you learn by yourself Just wondering because I was curious about this job since I am staring to think about what I want to do but I am currently doing computer science and it doesn t seem to be for me because it is kinda hard and its only lasting for semesters But anyways good vid I started to learn what the job is about What's the fla scraper thing you mentioned to automate the scraping Loved the video I ve been on this journey for a few months now and these videos along with other online content have been useful for checking my progress and keeping myself on track THANK YOU SO MUCH Could you tell me about the jobs What your employment looks like Are you a freelancer self employed or work for a company remotely Im really at the beginning just started at the Open University and it was a good overview what to expect These videos are definitely reducing my studying anxiety haha It's good to know that the struggle is normal and not something to be intimidated by Man you blew through your workout that fast What a beast cool i'm getting to know your channel now i'm having difficulty i use google sheets to do my basketball projections but when i play game results into the spreadsheet it is only upright do you know how to change that Thankyou sir Thank you so much for the tutorial Please upload the whole series about SQL Please enlarge screen next time and font size Hey everyone Thanks for watching Sorry if the volume is a little distorted I thought I fixed the problem but it looks like I haven't Will get it figured out by the next fundamentals video This is great I've always wanted to go into data science but I keep hearing the whole Go to college deal and honestly I can't do it now I did college and that was a failure Thanks for the video but why do yo have such a small screenshot of the code I m watching this on an iPad and my eyesight sucks Also what is the point of having your image in the lower right hand corner Does you image make it easier to comprehend what concepts and ideas your expressing All that negative space is distracting from your content which is interesting e Great can you tell me what exactly you did in data science projects and which tyoes of project you pickup and any company required data scientist then please tell me i am also data scientist my github https github com panditrahulsharma Can we include Geocodes in this Kindly help I'm stuck for days Can we use geocodes in this as well I order to know the location of tweets Kindly reply it's very important for my project currently Hello I am Brazilian and a student of Statistics I would like to know which professional gamblers you follow What if anyone has a youtube channel What are the referral bettors in your country Are there any football specialists Your honesty about affiliate links is highly appreciated Can I ask why are you focus so much on your videos What is the long term goal here Great vid Ken Looking forward to more content in Hey Ken sorry to bring up an old video Could you explain or at least direct me to information about cleaning the scraped twitter data how would you do that would you mind including the syntax to change several columns in one go Awesome You should have way more views I recommend checking smzeus I used it to promote my Instagram and it helped my posts start to trend It could really help you promote your videos too Thank you I work as Marketing Data Analytics Want to switch to sports analytics Thanks for your video Is the interview process for the internship roles the same as the full time ones For DS what questions are recommended in leetcode What about the coding languages Is it better to use python rather than java or both are ok How do you establish online presence to be in this field where do you usually get remote jobs in DS Thank you this helps a lot Would you recommend someone getting a data analyst internship before a data science internship Or just go straight for a data science internship Great resolutions Some of my comments Nice thought but optimise for what makes sense to YOU not to some arbitrary set of criteria of what qualifies a good code by engineers But obviously if you can't efficiently read reason about your own code then improvements are due Functions Objets aren't ALWAYS the right way forward and there are also pros and cons to speed of development VS meeting classic code standards Machine Learning is NOT the same as traditional programming and same measures of quality should not be blindly applied to both Good thought but just keep in mind that something that can take a whole evening if you go to an event can be consumed at x speed on youtube in mins Events are important for networking and benchmarking yourself against other professionals but don't have high expectations of actually LEARNING from talks it's rather inefficient Github is definitely a place to be Good README are always appreciated Please share everything you can you never know who could benefit from it Kaggle is amazing platform it could be very hard to get into their way of thinking it's like a parallel universe at first but there is also so much to learn there Just keep in mind that any particular technology that is state of the art today might be completely obsolete in a few years time Approaches to the problem and ways of thinking don't change as often Best resolution possible When you do your work truly end to end you really learn so much more I would focus on K S that you mentioned earlier I think it is the future and spending time learning AWS or Azure specific ML tools might not be the best investment of your time My resolutions Own my work more end to end same as your Have a say both in how data is collected and presented to the DS team as well as a say in how the final product looks and feels NOT being just a cog in a chain but truly understand meaning and impact of my work Get to a level of Master on Kaggle same as your if possible or at least do a few public kernels Attempt to build side projects which other people who aren't data scientists can interact with like that pix pix live demo Get more certifications and accreditations related to IT and ML Finally get into PyTorch properly and become an expert Improve my ability to read analyse scientific papers So I don't have to wait until some YouTuber reviews them to get an idea about what's going on in our field Get a grip on Probabilistic Programming I've been struggling with it for quite some time and I think I'll be able to make it useful soon Thank you for an interesting and relatable video I am studying BCA Bachelor of Computer Application in India I want to have a ms in data science from a institute But in our country India all institute provide PG diploma in Data Science Can you guide me in which country and which institute i can get a degree MS in Data Science with a handsome salary of job My resolution is to be as ready as I can be for when I start my masters in data science program at Denver next fall I will be using a lot of Codecademy Dataquest Udemy and Kahn Academy I would also like to have a handful of smaller projects uploaded to GitHub before the end of next summer I m new to data science and would like to know what you think the best programming languages are in the current state of the field As an analyst my resolution is to scrutinize each element of my reports and dashboards more I tend to focus more on the big picture and forget to focus on how each element could be improved As someone who is trying to learn data science my resolution is to give myself a project that seems achievable and finish it by the end of the year Documenting is one I think almost all of us can work on I can't imagine explaining data science I have enough trouble as it is explaining my job as a data analyst It has gotten to the point where I explain data as paint a blank excel or power bi file as a canvas and my job is to paint a picture that speaks to my audience Still think only half of my friends really understand Most just say oh so you know how to do pivot tables and move on The video was great sports analytics are a great subject I have a question about another area of data analysis nba that I want to ask you over email Twitter or etc PermissionError WinError Access is denied can I have help with the above error thank you Hi Ken your videos are very helpful Great video man Ok i subscribed Hi ken jee Thank you so much This is really helpful I feel like the creativity mindset is SOOO important I'm currently still looking for my first data science analytics job but while on the lookout I'm working on my own projects It definitely takes a lot of creativity to approach certain problems you want to find an answer to Really enjoying your vids Ken You could easily just make a bunch of those flashy salary of a data scientist or day in the life of a data scientist videos that have been beaten into the ground by every other youtuber but instead you're sharing much more relevant and actionable info Keep it up Get well soon Ken why not use jupyter lab this looks painful Ken get well soon Best regards from Russia First off it is good to know that I am getting into the field and not for the wrong reasons Thanks for the insight Having committed myself to securing my spot in a masters in data science program at Denver I think the number one driving factor in why I am even pursuing this field is I honestly believe there is a science to social interaction and I believe there can be an algorithm that can be created and used in conjunction with therapy for those who struggle with making friends dating establishing relationships and even have difficulty developing APPROPRIATE humor I have always wondered how some people can easily make friends seem to easily talk with women and enter into relationships with ease and how some people can have a sense of humor that gives off positive energy and draws people towards them Then there are those that no matter how in shape they get how good they may become at a given sport they may try all sorts of meetup groups yet every attempt to make new friends seems futile Making matters worse these people who struggle may try and utilize humor only to end up being making more of a fool of themselves This by no means will be an easy project and will require the skill sets acquired from a masters program and even more and it will probably involve doing a number of large surveys and even designing an interface that can measure speech patterns and measure non verbal body communication among several other variables such as proper clothing color selection ones facial attractiveness ones health status disabilities to name just a few I feel an algorithm involving highly complex mathematics that can be implemented in therapy may be the answer to curing the loneliness epidemic reducing addiction as a result of loneliness and decrease mortality related to loneliness I am sure this is bordering if not even getting into the field of artificial intelligence There is a science to successful social interaction and it's time to dig deep into the data Hope you get well soon nice and simple explanation thanks Hey Ken I've got a Data Science Internship interview this week and am very excited and nervous as hell to get my foot in the door Thanks so much for these videos they're honestly gold hey Ken can you plzz suggest me some data science projects Hey Ken AMAZING video If I collect my own data how can I reference it in the GitHub Is it a good practice to add the CSV txt file in the repository Loving ur channel so far Sports analytics basketball is the reason im getting into data science I participated in the NBA hackathon last year making it to second phase I plan on continuing my studies and go to the hackathon every year Keep up the great work loving these type of videos Ken TNX for very informative video Just if you need an idea regarding new videos I would be interested in your way to learn and apply new stuff effectively There is so much to learn on a regular basis It's currently tough for me to grasp what is really worth to spend time on e g learning statistics theory vs hand on experince by try and error Ken great video Can you post that spreadsheet to github I come from a non technical background My major is supply chain management with a minor in information systems I took a data science course and did well in it The course mainly covered more advanced statistical concepts not so much of programming I lack in computer skills the most I really enjoyed the course I currently work as a business analyst I am considering taking your advice to get a master's degree in Data Science from the University of Michigan Thanks for the information you provide on this channel Hello Ken thank you for everything you are making on YouTube It has been extremely helpful I was wondering could you go more in depth into what data scientists for NBA teams are currently working on I have trouble knowing what projects could create value because clubs seem to protect all of their in house work I am tossing between Statistics or Applied and Computational Mathematics as my major but I can't seem to figure out which one I should do I like data analysis and using R but I also like mathematical modelling with differential equations and such Most of the uncertainty for me comes from not knowing the type of work I would be doing in the real world Do you have any advice PS Very informative video first time watching Hi Ken your videos are very informative and keep me motivated on my data science journey If you can please make more videos on the fundamentals of data science it would be very helpful Thank you thank you sir agreed Hi ken Im pursuing a masters in applied statistics and data analytics with an emphasis in biostatistics i find that it might be overkill for doing data science My original goal was to apply learned knowledge as a biostatisician but throughout this entire year I've just been more drawn to data science and its business applications and am now leaning towards the business analytics concentration Nonetheless super stoked for the future and truly enjoy watching your channel Only a matter of time until you explode p s also calculus was the first class I was not able to pass and also recovering from it lol Great information Hi Ken I'm very interested in Data Science but I want to make sure I have my mathematics and statistics down Care to do a video on types of math and stat classes that I might want to take Appreciate the vids man Love that you incorporate NBA analytics in your channel Any recommendations for becoming a self taught DS Taking the DataQuest DS Python course right now It's been more hands on than other ones like Coursera which helps me learn better Any suggestions to accelerate the journey would be awesome Thanks man GiannisWinsMVP Ken great stuff Thanks for walking us through your simulation Quick question the way you calculate the score seems to skew the comparisons if one of the scores is high For example If one team score is say it averages to approx The other team score is It averages So the team that won by gets the win in the sim cause they scored a lot of points But the other team won by and had a better defense Do you see my point I'm thinking you ought to subtract and return a margin of victory then compare the margin of victory Maybe worth running simulations to see how different they are Thanks again Hey Ken I'm a systems engineer and aspiring Data Scientist in Haiti trying to incorporate automation and analytics in as many data structures as I can here as this field is basically non existent in my country As your channel is relatively new and growing I wanted to make a point to say thank you for your time and attention to detail in your videos They're not only extremely educational and helpful but have also helped me stay motivated to keep learning in a field where I am alone and have to rely on virtual help from individuals like yourself Hope this message serves as encouragement to keep going and to know that your efforts are seen and appreciated across borders All the best Pascal Brun Thank you Nice video I wonder what would be the sentiment of the comments here p I have a question is there a way to get all the comments from tweets from a specific user for a given period i e years Have been looking for a way to do that but I'm yet to be experienced nice to see some truly novel analysis outside of the millions of predicting handwritten digits from mnist videos Hey Thanks for the video I can see from the github page that I should somehow be able to check which users are verified users with the twitterscraper But I have just no idea on how I would implement that into your script Is that something you have tried and know how to do As always Ken great video Are you a data scientist Hi Ken Thank you so much your video I have question to you If you help me i would behappy Can I make a query like this with this method until since place d cd afd Place is including city information I want collect tweets from here Have nice day Hi I m a nurse and planning to shift into data science Will it be difficult coming from a non technical background How much is the starting salary for this profession Thank you Could you be my mentor in Data Analysis field I would like to communicate with you via stophyuni gmail com if you don t mind I hope you to send me an email if possible Would love to see more videos about sports analytics specifically in detail basketball nba this was very helpful Panda love to see that import statement video was a treat to watch Hi Ken I am from india and I've just begun my journey to become a dats scientist I'm not even really sure is data is the thing i love I'm exploring my options and would do masters accordingly Is it possible i can get in touch with you if I stumble upon something because you do look like you know what you're talking about And also i subscribed this is helpful Videos more than min will always catch my eye because they are the most helpful Thank you for your clip Could you also make a sample demo for regression or classification using the data of MLB baseball or FIFA soccer Over the course of a long tournament there is a mental benefit of hitting fairways But maybe longer hitters are psychologically able to respond to chaos better This is a great analysis It highlights in many ways the value of a caddy and the strategy that goes into every shot I imagine that players get printouts of each hole at a tournament and can gauge what risks are worth taking and which spots on the course that should be avoided at all costs Please can you told me how do you find your first client The field of data science will soon take over not only sports but even the health and fitness industry Looks like my decision to pursue a masters degree in this field may pay off GoodTalk I don't usually comment on videos but I just want to thank you for making these videos I really like the down to earth style with lots of practical advice Your videos have helped me a lot and I am definitely rooting for your success Thank you for Ken Thank you for ALL your recommendations I'm studying Data analaysis under master course in South Korea I have several questions below Do I need to follow the instructions in this video clip step by step Which is better to update portfolio between Github and Kaggle Which site could be a proper sameple to collect data at the beginning step Hello ken What kind of algorithms one should know for the data science coding interview Thanks for watching I would love the hear about the different ways that you have earned some extra income as a data scientist in the section below Thank you for sharing Thank you for sharing Is it possible to crawl both tweet posts and their replies using Twitterscraper for few years backdated data Hey Ken can you be elaborate about how and where from you choose the projects And also how do go about them Do you learn on the go Thank you Ken I needed this Thanks Ken This was very informative Is it possible to use hours and minutes in addition to the date to get the tweets from a specific period of time I have been trying to play with it and I am not sure if there is a particular dt function that needs to be used Nice job Ken Boss So sick to see your own analysis on the youtube data Well done Hi Everyone It is my hope that analysis like this will help me to produce better content for you all I love making these videos and I hope that you are finding them interesting and useful This analysis and the growth of my channel would not be possible without you watching Thank you again for staying tuned Please do a follow up video explaining the effects ve or ve of you findings on your channel did your channel actually grow Really a very informative video I am a undergrad student in computer science and I would like to have a career in data science I tried to do some self study online but I am still confused if I am doing things write or not I want to where to start and what to start with I also don't have a good statistics background but I have a good experience in programming in Python so please if you can tell about how to start and where to start Thank you so much Thank you for your videos Super helpful and realistic no artificial stuff Love it Great content Your videos give me a great insight into the career field I am wanting to get into I must say your are spot on when you mentioned happiness and how being stimulated by working on something can drive happiness Seeking happiness and a career field with mental stimulation may be the number one driving factor as to why I am wanting to enter this career field not to mention the other perks as well Yes data science is right for me in probably more ways than the number of roommates I've had the last years which is too many lol However like you said in one of your comments below getting into the field ASAP through being a data analyst would probably be a better bet for someone in my situation who is severely underemployed has loads of debt and wants to have a better quality of life In all honesty I would be quite content with a data analyst role I would see it as a stepping stone and an opportunity to improve in all areas in life I see becoming a data scientist with an emphasis on big data engineering or machine learning engineering as long term goals and becoming a data analyst as more of a short term goal months with luck and or strategic networking maybe months Would you have a method similar to this for scraping facebook data I have a masters in exercise science but I want to get into data science machine learning I am looking at the University of Denver's masters program in data science and they do have courses in machine learning but from what I read in some of their course descriptions they use Java instead of Python or R I seem to read that Python and or R are the two main programming languages used in data science Being that I have no experience in the computer science field should I go for this type of program or should I go for a masters in computer science at my local university which also has courses on advanced algorithms and machine learning Thank you Awesome tutorial and an amazing find Btw could you perhaps also do a video on how to get a library of users from twitterscrapper I tried using the author's example get twitter user data parallel py but to no avail kept running into problems Don't know if it is just me though thank you for you video it's helpfull please i want to get all Trump tweets when i run the following import twitterscraper as ts ts query query tweets from user 'Danone' i get only the tweets for the last months appreciate the description Thank you for sharing After publishing the video it appears that I left out an extremely important part of selling You need to understand your customer and make sure that you are providing an analysis that is relevant to their end goals If you are speaking to business stakeholders they are usually focused on profit loss user experience or other performance metrics Make sure that you are tying the value of your work to these metrics that are important to them Thanks again for watching THanks for the video It's brought me closer to my objective than anything else But when I input this line tweets query tweets hungergames begindate begin date enddate end date limit limit lang lang it hangs on this might mean sth in python New python user here so I think it is asking for more code Or does using a hastag mess things up Ken thanks a lot for your sharing may I ask how much crypto currency you have earned using the model informative contents keep goin bro Hey Ken That was great what exactly do you do I want to work remote too Hi ken thanks for sharing When I try to scrap Tweets I found I only can scrap tweets up to week ago I tried to set the sartdate as and enddate is today but I can only got Tweets from to today How can I get the old data Because it seems we can get much more older data using Twitterscraper Thank you Looking forward to your reply I thought for sure I could be the annoying guy that said you forgot about how the pt shot helps the value of a pt shot I was wrong great video as usual Love the way you break this stuff down and cover the shortfalls at the end I think there are quite a few things the NBA should look into before this most importantly scheduling Your video helped me a lot So thank you Any ideas on how to export the data into csv file anyone When I try to save the data as anything other than spyderdata I get the message Unable to save current workspace Error message type to array is my begin date what version of Anaconda and Python did you use Hi Ken Thanks for the video Is it possible to scrap tweets from one username for a specific time interval import twitterscraper as ts import datetime as dt tweets ts query query tweets from user 'JoeBiden' I would like the dates from to begin date dt date end date dt date but query tweets does not seem to take a username parameter Can you please provide some assistance Thank you for your time One thing that helps with the sedentary part of the data science job or any computer heavy job is a treadmill desk You don't need anything fancy just a cheap treadmill a shelf from a hardware store or an old bookcase a couple of bungee cords and voila a home made treadmill desk Yeah G Hope you have a good trip Also save some of that PTO for some Utah shred time Well said Ken Enjoy Hawaii Great Thanks i have mediocre level knowledge on a couple of programming languages How would i start working on any of the projects that you mentioned in the video Thank you I thought I will need an API or something XD Bro work on the sound level it's too low Plz increase your sound volumes Hi Is it possible to get entry level data analytics job without a degree I am a year old college student driving for uber in LA I hate my life right now lol Learning python XL SQL tablue Online now planning to do Udacity data Analytics nano degree Like to know ur thoughts Thanks You are doing a great work Ken Thanks for the video Thank you Ken I most definitely prefer the PyCharm IDE seems overall more flexible and more options Thanks for the video Hey Ken Good content as always Can you maybe speak in a mic I often find myself having to bump my volume up Appreciated Ken Hi ken i inputted the code you recommended in order to extract the tweets from only donald trump but now I am having a problem with the last command Below is the code i used import twitterscraper as ts import datetime as dt import pandas as pd begin date dt date end date dt date limit lang 'english' ts query query tweets from user 'realDonaldTrump' df pd DataFrame t dict for t in tweets with regard to the final sentence when i input it i am getting NameError name 'tweets' is not defined how do i define the word tweets or what code should i use I am trying to get the nice table where it shows the tweets Hey Ken thank you very much for your helpful video Maybe you can help me regarding my question How do I get all tweets from a specific user Simply implementing the argument 'user' lang lang user 'realDonaldTrump' leads to an unexpected keyword argument error What am I doing wrong here Thanks in advance Love the analysis thought it was super interesting Thought of another question as I am working toward switch fields to data science What types of things would you want to see on a resume CV with no formal data science background besides data science projects and github Love this video and this kind of content I can imagine that if the line was moved back to feet that there would be a massive trickle down effect Great shooters would be even more valuable and spacing would be insane in the nba for teams who can convert from that far out Corner threes would be a cheat code at that point too since they cant be moved back any further I wonder if the court will ever get bigger to address this I for one like how the NBA is played right now but am always fascinated by major changes and how teams adapt That Steph graph was kinda surprising Wow is this a coincidence I just talked with one of my group members about pointers in Big league and other stuff relating to sports data analysis this afternoon Just as I arrived at home a couple mins ago I turned on my computer and saw this fresh new video which talks about NBA point line So I immediately commented before watching Hi I was actually struggling on an assignment for hours together and finally encountered your video it solved my issues within minutes I immediately subscribed and ended up on this one Keep doing more videos You rock hi this year I'm going to finish school and I have to chose a career so which career would u think which is better IT statist or business thank u After long time Was waiting for your new video The th habit is using the whiteboard which doesn't have to be too big Good stuff to do mind mapping before getting into daily work THANK YOU SOOOOOO MUCH Hi Ken thank you for creating the channel i like all your videos especially the fundamental ones as i can follow and utilize it to analyse other datasets from Kaggle and hopefully create my own projects as my package for Business Intelligence type of role interview as I'm an MBA student worked years in marketing How much flexible are the working hours Is it that you have work daily for hrs or weekly goals are there Can we pursue other career and do the work of data scientist simultaneously as a part time Great job I like seeing the project end to end I have avoided web scraping because I'm still unclear on when it's OK to do it and when it's not and I'm the kind of person who avoids at all costs doing something that might get me in trouble I've read quite a few robots txt files and many of them specifically disallow crawlers other than the usual search engines yet some people feel comfortable scraping those sites Do you have any guidelines for deciding when it is OK to scrape and when it isn't I like Kaggle for its competitions and for its kernels which as you said are one of the best ways of learning practical data science lessons Also I love YouTube even though I do most of my learning from reading not from watching videos The reason YouTube feels special is that some YouTubers are great at storytelling They help me have a more personal connection to what I'm learning I watched every video of this channel more than times Seriously this long sleeve t shirt link lmao Hi Ken I am an Industrial Engineering graduate student with a keen interest in data and supply chain Can you tell me something about how the scope will be like if I enter into the field of data as I am bit ambiguous in which area do I need to do research or project Your advice is spot on be prepared to put a lot of time and effort into learning in truth the learning never stops be proactive about finding problems and solving them plus keep in mind there's a difference between asking for help because you're truly stuck vs asking for help because you're too lazy to figure out how to solve a problem Data scientists are supposed to be really good at problem solving Being a data scientist who's asking for help all the time kind of undermines the purpose of being a data scientist learn the math I actually believe that most people have the ability to understand the math but most have been taught math in a way that's not relevant enough nor interesting enough to them When done right I can't see how anyone can not love math learn coding tell great stories Also a quote I heard recently makes a nice addition For some data science is an opportunity For me data science is a passion When you go into the field for the right reasons you'll do whatever it takes to get great at it I enjoyed watching this video Keep up the great work Ken Lee I've just discovered your channel You're doing a very nice job with your videos a balance of practical tips and encouraging advice Keep up the great work Hi Ken thanks for the video Is there a way to segment the age and the country Hi Kan Could you make a video tutorial on Feature engineering Not the basic fiillna one hot encoding etc I mean some advanced feature engineering techniques like X x y etc It will be much helpful for people like me Thanks and have a good day Hey man congratulations on the milestone I'm so proud of you Can you make a data science course that would be really helpful hey man congrats on the milestone I think main request would be projects start to finish big or small doesn't matter I just think there's plenty of theoretical content out there books videos etc but building helps to solidify learning As a new ML student that's what i'd love to see Congrats Ken Definitely deserve more Wish Congratulations on k subscribers Still many to come N yeah your contents have definitely helped me thank you n keep it up Your videos encouraged me to opt for Data Science in my university Thank you You deserve it very very helpful contents thank you D Do more skits that was funny Love it This is just exactly what i need Thank you so much Hope your channel will have many viewers What is the relation of deep learning and data science And how data science is helping AI in day to day life Hey Ken I've opted for Data Science as my majors in my university but I've a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning Can you explain how data science can help me work in AI and ML Good to see you Good content Keep it up Hey Ken I have a few data science projects python sql that i'm working on while taking edx classes but also work full time as mech engineer trying to switch careers The emphasis on masters seems to be quite apparent among DS jobs especially in Cali If I want to go through masters in cs i would have to be part time financial reasons but also put all my projects on hold due to time constraint It would take roughly year for me to get around solid projects to complete but years for my masters What are your thoughts about this going the personal project route or masters route I wish I can do both but that is a recipe for a burnout I enjoy the technicality of DS and want to get into the industry asap great vid btw thanks Have you used Naive Bayes Alg Awesome vid Where did you learn this stuff Lol this video showed more of you not working than actually working minutes in and you haven't started working yet Liked your video again Thank u for ur efforts Really appreciate it appreciate the detailed step by step tutorial one concern though for the cylinder column would it make sense to fill na with the mean cylinder values Nice to see how your day goes for this kind of job Thanks for sharing A few things I omitted are Hackathons and Kaggle competitions These are both great ways to earn experience as well I'm new to data science and this is a great tip to look forward to Did you learn from any online courses If you did are there any you recommend Thanks for the video At you mention a cheat sheet Do you recommend any in particular I've tried looking but quality tends to vary a lot hey ken just found your channel as someone who is aspiring make a career change towards data science your videos have a lot of helpful content for a beginner like me thanks and as always keep up the good work hi ken great video I have a Question use your code Try mine but results have overlapping values Hey ken I just completed my graduation and I am currently doing data science course from a local reputated institute Our exposure to actual real world work is v minimum So some advice from a person like you will mean a lott Thanks Ken Hey Ken thanks for another great video I have a question regarding working for a non profit or a small company though Do you literally knock on their door and ask if you could apply your skills to their project I was thinking of doing this as an option if I don't get an internship before I graduate Do you sleep Keep churning out this quality content ken Hey Ken I heard that one needs to have an advanced degree or a lot of knowledge in calculus and statistics in order to get a job in data science I m interested in getting into data science and big data but am not sure about having the required formal education with advanced mathematics Thanks Where is the Avenger's video I totally forgot how to get the comparative graphs for before and after in lines graphs Please help Codes you are writing downside are not visible please take care of that issue Otherwise the video is awesome hello Ken I want to pull protected tweets from a friend which means I need to login Will something like that work with twitterscrapper or should I just go ahead and beg Twitter for an api key hey ken i just subscribed plzz a heart for me as well Thanks great advice Hey Ken what kind of math requirements are needed for data scientist Wow thank you YouTube algo I m an undergrad DS major and can t wait to share with others in my major Hi Ken A very helpful video which made me confident that I am going in the right path I am currently in Canada and about of the DS job applications ask for either a masters Ph D degree which made me demotivated a little but your video motivated me to continue what I am doing right now I have made a Flask web app to predict the rent of apartments in Toronto The model was trained on data scraped from various online portals and with the help fo third party API like walk score HERE maps etc I was able to make a regression model The link to the app is https gtarent herokuapp com not mobile friendly at the moment I would love to get feedback from your side if possible Thanks Akhil you look like a boss Hey Ken Could you elaborate more on last points in your next video Comment first then watch u jost got urself a fellow data science student subscriber Hey PSA maybe pin this or comment this yourself but as of right now doesn't really work It's query tweets is broken and you're going to have to specifically install pip install twitterscraper in order to use it Also for anyone wondering about performance issues and harvesting tons of tweets make use of the poolsize parameter Poolsize controls the number of parallel scrapers you can have up at a single time At maximum you can have one scraper per day So for example if you are scraping a period of days you can use poolsize to get parallel scrapers running at a time If you want to harvest over a big time frame try to harvest smaller time periods and loop through dates manually otherwise your CPU RAM and internet usage will shoot through the roof That should give you the best mix of performance and speed Can you make a vid of your resume so that we can learn from that Thank you for sharing man This is amazing thank you for the knowledge When you're loading into the variable explorer what are you pressing Also how are you running the script I got it to work a few times but it seems to stop working randomly Thanks again for your help THANKS for uploading good videos for data science I have watched your all videos Can you make a video on what type of project we can make to put it on our resume and learn from it It would be a great pleasure if you make a beginner to pro Thank you Hey man just wanted to let you know that these are greatly appreciated Hi I am doing MCA now I am interested in data science I am think to do courses in data science U can plz tell some tips hi great video thanks for that I have a problem with reaching the limit do you know why can it be an issue I set limit as and I got only tweets setting bigger limit gives similar results Great video It really shows your passion for Data Science how can i get location Thanks for the video keep it up This is awesome So helpful One more question if I would like to write the tweets from this method with a track word to a json file how do I access the tweet info For example when I want to print the tweets twitterscraper tweet Tweet object at x b d I get something like this which I understand but I'm not sure how to retrieve the actual information from it Looking at API documentation the tweet object should have attributes like 'text' and 'id' and so on But when I try tweets 'text' I get an error instead DO you know how I could write it into a file also by not using pandas as there is an issue with that library on my end currently which I haven't been able to fix unfortunately nice video Hi Ken thanks for this great video I am currently looking into scraping data from different accounts e g Danone How can I scrape all tweets from a specific account hi how would we sample real time tweets Instead of searching through a track word can we create a sample if all publicly available tweets at the time by say by language Thank you Sir for sharing your knowledge I am know motivated to work much more harder in order for me to become data scientist Dude this is the life I need to live I am finishing my BS in physics And a professional career in freeskiing About to start applying for data science analysis here in Salt Lake City I can t wait to start grinding like you This video serves a great model for me thank you I m excited to see where my career and this whole data science field will go Great Keep going Another great detailed video Thanks ken I have a request for you Could you do a project where you predict the winner of FIFA world cup I would like to see how you gather data and which approch you take to work on the project Hey Ken Big fan I just landed my first internship and would like to really thank you for your videos Hello Ken Thank you for numerous helpful videos I am excited about your future uploads I am a Data science major who is also interested in working in sports analytics field especially soccer Hope I can learn from you a lot I added you on LinkedIn so we can get connected as well Thank you Good video Which type of Msc degree program that accepts student with different background Could you illustrate this point naming the program and the college Hello everyone Dan one of my followers pointed out that in this analysis I actually included the dependent variable minutes played many of the methods that I tested Obviously this is not something that you should do After re running the analysis with the correct adjustments made these were my findings Just Previous Game Prediction Score Previous Three Games Rolling Avg Score Previous Five Games Rolling Avg Score Previous Ten Games Rolling Avg Score Previous Three Games Rolling Median Score Previous Five Games Rolling Median Score Previous Ten Games Rolling Median Score It looks like the past game rolling average is actually the best performing of this group Linear Model Performance RMSE Random Forest Performance RMSE Combined Model Performance RMSE As expected the ensemble model performs the best It appears that adding the linear component does provide a small amount of lift to the results Feature Importance pavg pavg pavg pmed pmed playStat Starter pmed playStat Bench prevgm pstd pstd pstd teamDayOff playPos PG playPos SG playPos SF playPos PF playPos C playPos F playPos G dtype float I have a wired question will learning code for example python become literally common sense eventually I ve seen a lot of data scientists carry laptops with perhaps commands of code to help guide them to applying the code to whatever it is they re coding say on their PC Is that something that is viable for a data scientist working with code You got subscriber Thanks for New approach interesting that you are doing QA work When you say QA I'm assuming you mean QA'ing the coding behind the dashboard you were looking at The only part I would get involved with is QA'ing the data behind the dashboard and not the interface itself Do you have an IT team that can build the dashboard for you or are you doing everything yourself with your team Hey man been watching your videos and thinking about switching from Mechanical Engineering to Data Science I have a decent amount of experience in python and popular libraries inside of it At what point would you consider someone hirable Say today's date is j and yesterdays date is j are you using data through j to predict minutes played on date j and for the RMSE calculation If not you will be understating the error Just wondering because it wasn't clear from just glancing at the code you have in your video Very informative video Any thoughts how to handle simulation for data that is not normally distributed I'm thinking of player FGM for example that doesn't seem to be normally distributed Very informative video Any thoughts how to habdle simulation for data that is not normally distributed I'm thinking of player FGM for example that doesn't seem go be normally distributed Very useful information Thank you so much Awesome content Thank you so much for taking the time out to post this My goal is to finish out my undergrad in computer science get my masters to become a PA then combine the two professions working as a clinician in addition to working in data science in healthcare I know that this route is completely unorthodox but I m okay with being untraditional lol Does this sound like a feasible plan Good title would of you have done a Data Science school bootcamp I'm applying to Lambda School's Data Science course which is months long Much more time than some week bootcamp there's just too much to learn within such a small time frame Hi I am using your code to retrieve tweets from specific Twitter accounts from twitterscraper import query tweets import datetime as dt import pandas as pd begin date dt date end date dt date limit user 'AleFerruzcal' tweets query tweets begindate begin date enddate end date limit limit user user BUT I GOT THIS ERROR TypeError query tweets got an unexpected keyword argument 'user' Could you tell me how should I take in the 'user' filter into your code Would you say a masters in business analytics is worth it reply me plz i do same like you did i write code same like your but there nothing in my variable explorer hours ago courser is rotating How can i extract data from particular page eg realDonaldTrump of last months with out filtering For an internship how much do they expect you to know This is super worth watching I'm going give this a try soon To be able to see the text clearly you have to watch the video in HD The code is below for convenience from twitterscraper import query tweets import datetime as dt import pandas as pd begin date dt date end date dt date limit lang 'english' tweets query tweets 'notre dame fire' begindate begin date enddate end date limit limit lang lang df pd DataFrame t dict for t in tweets Awesome content I play Daily Fantasy sports everyday and fascinated with Data science so I am extremely interested in this content No benchmark is low if the price is in a trend FOr financial data deep learning is not very useful at least at this stage If you aren't interested in the code feel free to skip to for the findings Hey man Loving the videos Can you increase the audio volume in the future Wow your channel is just what I needed Thanks from new subscriber Dang you deserve way more subscribers and views Really awesome mate I am a BIG no HUGE believer in sharing your journey It can be so helpful to so many others Keep it up Love you candid style Always be yourself Power On Avi Great video bro The problem with these sort of codes is that you are predicting the past It just follows the line of the past and can't make predictions for the future So if you want to loose money go a head and use this technique Link to Medium Article https towardsdatascience com how to get a data science interview in d df d Hi Ken my name is Peter I play a bunch of DFS and I do pretty well but I have a glaring deficiency and it's my lack of programming statistics skills I enjoyed the video on NBA minutes I think I have some ideas that could make your models even better than they already are and we could both benefit My email is PeterTaranovich Gmail com Let me know if you have any interest in collaborating Regardless it's a great video and I appreciate you posting it Hello everyone Thank you for your comments Unfortunately due to some legal paperwork I signed I am unable to share the repository for this project I am happy to answer any questions about what tools I used here Nice presentation Short sweet and clean Github code It was promised months ago Any updates on this Is it still better than in the bear market There is no github What do you think about NARX Any experience with it Dear Ken May I know how the input data with Open High Low Close Volume can be hourly I think thats should be daily data What's your prediction Ken for or at least the next months Triple bottom Nice I have some nice models for this doing very well How did you make out Great video Can you please post the github link Thank you Hi Ken I've been researching about this Would be really helpful if you could share the code and softwares used I hope they are open source Thanks again for the great content \""
