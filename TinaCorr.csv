Personally I recommend Waterloo's Computing and Financial Management undergrad. It's basically a double major between computer science and finance with 2 years of co-op. Every big company in US/Canada/China is recruiting nearly every semester. 
...
You've got Jane Street, GTS, Virtu, Citadel, DRW, Hudson River Trading, Capula, Morgan Stanley, HSBC, Goldman, the Canadian banks, etc. 
Plus the smaller quant startups, and the usual suspects: Google (hires 20-75 students per term from Waterloo), Facebook (~10ish), Amazon, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei, Tesla, Bloomberg, Microsoft, Darwin AI, and a ton of other tech companies from NY, Silicon Valley, Austin, and Toronto. There's usually about 4000-11,000 job postings per semester for tech.

300,300,"I'm a prospective candidate for MCIT at the University of Pennsylvania for FALL 2021.I'm from India and I have a quite peculiar background. In India, the education system in high school is if we don't elect maths in Grade 11 and 12, we can't study it after in our college or in post-graduation at all. So I didn't have maths in my high school grade 12 and ended up taking a new course in my college called logistics management. It was quite astonishing that this course was introduced in my college just in 2014 and I joined the 3 rd batch of the program in 2017. In my college days, there wasn't any term called data science as such so if it was available I would have taken it. I had the constant love for I.T and computer though I didn't study in my undergrad at all. In India, it's difficult to study CS and I.T if you are not an engineering or CS grad. I came through an online course provider called Coursera and looked for the University of Pennsylvania's MCIT program. I'm interested for the on campus program of MCIT. The first-in-kind program made for Non- CS graduate and I was really happy seeing it. The beauty of US education is it's quite flexible and you can still pursue your dream even back when you couldn't due to some reasons.  I wanted to know some information about this program like what does the University of Penn looks while selecting a class from very diverse backgrounds and cultures. I want to be in the class of 2021 or 2022. How can I proceed further for this program? It would be a great help if you could guide me little. I'm an Aspiring data scientist and computer programmer. My CGPA is 7.54 on a 10 scale under indian system. I would be taking GRE soon . Shall I apply and give a shot ?

449,449,"Arvind's post about MCIT Online vs. On Campus: 

These are not in any order of importance. I talked about the personal connection aspect first simply because that to me is the most significant one.

Number of electives - Whatever happens, I'll be extremely shocked if the number of electives in the online space becomes equal to the number of electives on campus. We, the faculty, get hired, to produce the on campus courses.

Variety of electives - As most of you know, you are allowed to take 1 approved non-CIS elective. This is a pretty popular option. No chance of doing this if you do the online version.

Research - Completely unclear to me how an online student gets to do research with faculty. Past cohorts (including the one that just graduated) have had at least one if not more students who have managed to work with our faculty on research projects. Some of them have gone on to do PhDs. No research --> very low chance of a PhD.

Going on to a dual degree with CIS, CGGT, Robo - Fairly sure that these are opportunities that only on-campus students have.

Mental health resources - CAPS is not something that online students have access to. I'm also not sure the students have access to the Weingarten learning center either.

Immigration - Online students cannot get an F-1 visa.

Recitations - Recitations in the online world do not have even 1/10th of the discussion and asking TAs questions that the on-campus world does. For certain topics, we feel that students explaining their thoughts to other students or talking to TAs makes a world of difference.

Who's teaching you - I'm putting this one last because I kinda feel awkward saying ""my team is the best"" (unless I'm at the Linc!). If you take a look at the last 7-8 years of MCIT on-campus teaching and the last 2 years or so of MCIT online teaching you will find that the MCIT core classes have always been taught by teaching track faculty. This is not the case with MCIT online. Teaching track faculty are instructors whose primary job description is teaching, and not research. Our tenure track/tenured faculty has many amazing teachers. But I'd like to think that being taught by teaching track faculty as opposed to tenure track/tenured faculty in that important and formative first year can make a difference.",Ugz-kcxlCdNc65g32jd4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2UXDak6o7rBm23k3Vv5dww,Tina Huang,3,2,2020-08-30 23:09:08+00:00,rd1HKwJT6GM,3,Upenn MCIT Program Details and Real Student Experiences - Dr. Arvind Bhusnurmath,2020-08-30,arvind post mcit online v campus order importance talked personal connection aspect first simply significant one number elective whatever happens extremely shocked number elective online space becomes equal number elective campus faculty get hired produce campus course variety elective know allowed take approved non ci elective pretty popular option chance online version research completely unclear online student get research faculty past cohort including one graduated least one student managed work faculty research project gone phd research low chance phd going dual degree ci cggt robo fairly sure opportunity campus student mental health resource cap something online student access also sure student access weingarten learning center either immigration online student cannot get visa recitation recitation online world even th discussion asking ta question campus world certain topic feel student explaining thought student talking ta make world difference teaching putting one last kinda feel awkward saying team best unless linc take look last year mcit campus teaching last year mcit online teaching find mcit core class always taught teaching track faculty case mcit online teaching track faculty instructor whose primary job description teaching research tenure track tenured faculty many amazing teacher like think taught teaching track faculty opposed tenure track tenured faculty important formative first year make difference,0,"{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.782, 'pos': 0.183, 'compound': 0.9831}",0.035,0.183,0.782,0.9831

I'm just really curious and I haven't found a lot of people with exactly this situation and I feel like I am in a similar situation as you were a few years ago.
So back then you weren't a US citizen (did you live in the US?) and you just applied to a lot of companies online and then later heard back from a few of them, right?
Did you only apply to one location specifically or to multiple ones? Did the company then just handle the visa etc. for you?
I'm from Europe and looking into internships opportunities for the next year. I just wondered if it is ""ok"" to send out applications to company locations outside one's current residence, because so far I kind of thought that was absurd or unrealistic (of course there are opportunities here too, just not that many).

It's also interesting that so much of the interview took place virtually - I'm guessing that is how things will be for the time being as well, including the final round most likely.

491,491,Hi Tina! Congratulations on landing a full-time DS job!  I found out about your videos through RTC and they have been v insightful. I have a couple of questions about your DS application experience. How did you study SQL by yourself? Are there any specific resources you'd recommend? I am also wondering what kind of technical questions did you encounter in your DS interviews. Were they similar to SWE interview questions (you mentioned some of these in your Part 1 video)? Would you recommend brushing up on data structures and general leetcode questions for data science interview as well?

I found myself lacking some of the skills and requirements the companies ask for in SWE OR DS roles .  Have you ever faced a situation like this?  Do you just self-study those tools and learn those skills if your program’s course curriculum didn’t prepare you for those requirements?  Another question is, had you worked on any side projects in software engineering or data science? Or do you just put class projects on your resume/profile?  I would like to figure out how much time I should put on side projects if they are essential to job applications.
