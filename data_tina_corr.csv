449,449,Arvind's post about MCIT Online vs On Campus These are not in any order of importance I talked about the personal connection aspect first simply because that to me is the most significant one Number of electives Whatever happens I'll be extremely shocked if the number of electives in the online space becomes equal to the number of electives on campus We the faculty get hired to produce the on campus courses Variety of electives As most of you know you are allowed to take 1 approved non CIS elective This is a pretty popular option No chance of doing this if you do the online version Research Completely unclear to me how an online student gets to do research with faculty Past cohorts including the one that just graduated have had at least one if not more students who have managed to work with our faculty on research projects Some of them have gone on to do PhDs No research very low chance of a PhD Going on to a dual degree with CIS CGGT Robo Fairly sure that these are opportunities that only on campus students have Mental health resources CAPS is not something that online students have access to I'm also not sure the students have access to the Weingarten learning center either Immigration Online students cannot get an F 1 visa Recitations Recitations in the online world do not have even 1 10th of the discussion and asking TAs questions that the on campus world does For certain topics we feel that students explaining their thoughts to other students or talking to TAs makes a world of difference Who's teaching you I'm putting this one last because I kinda feel awkward saying my team is the best unless I'm at the Linc If you take a look at the last 7 8 years of MCIT on campus teaching and the last 2 years or so of MCIT online teaching you will find that the MCIT core classes have always been taught by teaching track faculty This is not the case with MCIT online Teaching track faculty are instructors whose primary job description is teaching and not research Our tenure track tenured faculty has many amazing teachers But I'd like to think that being taught by teaching track faculty as opposed to tenure track tenured faculty in that important and formative first year can make a difference ,Ugz-kcxlCdNc65g32jd4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2UXDak6o7rBm23k3Vv5dww,Tina Huang,3,2,2020-08-30 23:09:08+00:00,rd1HKwJT6GM,3,Upenn MCIT Program Details and Real Student Experiences - Dr. Arvind Bhusnurmath,2020-08-30,arvind's post mcit online v campus order importance talked personal connection aspect first simply significant one number elective whatever happens i'll extremely shocked number elective online space becomes equal number elective campus faculty get hired produce campus course variety elective know allowed take 1 approved non ci elective pretty popular option chance online version research completely unclear online student get research faculty past cohort including one graduated least one student managed work faculty research project gone phd research low chance phd going dual degree ci cggt robo fairly sure opportunity campus student mental health resource cap something online student access i'm also sure student access weingarten learning center either immigration online student cannot get f 1 visa recitation recitation online world even 1 10th discussion asking ta question campus world certain topic feel student explaining thought student talking ta make world difference who's teaching i'm putting one last kinda feel awkward saying team best unless i'm linc take look last 7 8 year mcit campus teaching last 2 year mcit online teaching find mcit core class always taught teaching track faculty case mcit online teaching track faculty instructor whose primary job description teaching research tenure track tenured faculty many amazing teacher i'd like think taught teaching track faculty opposed tenure track tenured faculty important formative first year make difference
