156,156,Oh man What an excellent and beautiful video I have learned so much these past few months become so much better it blows my mind And it wasn't just Machine learning either That being said being part of the 66daysofdata community has certainly been a very large contributor to this so many thanks for the opportunity And one thing that I found that helps for practically everything is something that I learned while watching a very old movie named the Silent Flute The script was originally written by none other than Bruce Lee who died before he could shoot it It was taken over and the 'master' was played by none other than David Carradine And despite showing its old age it's full of wisdoms One of them in particular struck a major cord inside me when David Carradine playing the master who according to his student seemed to know everything he simply answered with this Every time the sun rises like the student on their first day of school I open a blank page in my mind to write the lesson of the day After which I wrote this on a blank page and added and have an actual real blank page ready to write the lesson on it I started this on the 14th of may and well still doing this every single day It's incredible how much you can learn about everything when doing this little exercise and I certainly do like to mention Machine Learning here and there Like say pointing out the importance of iterations in practically everything you can do and learn in life Or use lessons I learned from something else say art and apply them to my Machine Learning studies The kind that says sometimes it's good to switch to something different not only does it allows you to go back later with a fresh mind but even better for all you know the other project you'll be working might give you ideas for the first one Just watching this video is bringing back to memory some of the stuff that I have written in this 'book of wisdom' of mine and makes me want to say so many things about it that I won't do it This post is already getting very long as it is sorry for the wall of text come to think of it I need to write one on how to try to summarize my point of views much more briefly Good luck to everyone for not just your 66daysofdata not your 666daysofdata but why not your alifeofdata ,UgySzTv9KuO3hKxzqPl4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9rpez4HdB40iFgTLbZS7yg,Daedalus Dream Journal,1,6,2020-11-13 13:20:53+00:00,4039x4r-hGE,1,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,2020-11-13,oh man excellent beautiful video learned much past month become much better blow mind machine learning either said part 66daysofdata community certainly large contributor many thanks opportunity one thing found help practically everything something learned watching old movie named silent flute script originally written none bruce lee died could shoot taken 'master' played none david carradine despite showing old age full wisdom one particular struck major cord inside david carradine playing master according student seemed know everything simply answered every time sun rise like student first day school open blank page mind write lesson day wrote blank page added actual real blank page ready write lesson started 14th may well still every single day incredible much learn everything little exercise certainly like mention machine learning like say pointing importance iteration practically everything learn life use lesson learned something else say art apply machine learning study kind say sometimes good switch something different allows go back later fresh mind even better know project working might give idea first one watching video bringing back memory stuff written 'book wisdom' mine make want say many thing post already getting long sorry wall text come think need write one try summarize point view much briefly good luck everyone 66daysofdata 666daysofdata alifeofdata

237,237,In my opinion you should stick to the field you are interested in And data should be complicated enough to be worth analyzing not like two columns But to get both the data and the idea is the biggest problem for me so far I either have the idea but it's nearly impossible to find any decent amount of data or there would be lots of data but on a topic that I've never found the least exciting Sometimes data isn't complicated enough for a project For instance I do monitor used cars sales on a regular basis I just love reading about cars comparing them But the tricky thing is there are like 5 or 6 variables to utilize like mileage color horsepower year produced etc It's more than enough for eda but there is not much room for machine learning project The only interesting idea I came up with apart fromobvious linear regression is to analyze whether mileage is real or not based on the price number of owners etc It seems like some fields are inferior in terms of generating data than others,Ugwec0TyabkXgwV1e7F4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdlkZO58Gl-uOfLjmeSS7gQ,Максим Базанов,1,1,2020-11-06 16:12:31+00:00,yUrrf3Pm33s,1,Find a Data Science Project With These 3 Techniques,2020-11-06,opinion stick field interested data complicated enough worth analyzing like two column get data idea biggest problem far either idea nearly impossible find decent amount data would lot data topic i've never found least exciting sometimes data complicated enough project instance monitor used car sale regular basis love reading car comparing tricky thing like 5 6 variable utilize like mileage color horsepower year produced etc enough eda much room machine learning project interesting idea came apart fromobvious linear regression analyze whether mileage real based price number owner etc seems like field inferior term generating data others

401,401,Hi great video some tips for the reader from what I learned from work 1 I recommend to start including git in every project you do I didn t do that but I wish i did It helps like ken said with version control and easier changes publishing instead of going online and going through a whole process and also ur gonna use it at work for sure so might as well practice 2 He s using GitBash idk if it was mentioned and I missed it but that s the command line interface to use git It s also good cause it uses Bash so if u know Linux Ubuntu it s be easier to use I use the same but there are others if you don t want to start with a command line like VsCode Atom GitHub Desktop although I recommend Bash 3 use Git Status pretty much after every command because If ur in ur own branch and want to switch to another one all your work will be lost if not committed or stashed first Git Stash is just what it sounds like temporarily stashed or saves your changes to the side so u can do other work and then Pop later ,UgwTSYNgmCTE_t0h9yx4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4CiwFWd0GY9gr_fkZYYTRg,Ray Ojel,1,1,2020-10-24 12:45:53+00:00,_0rHU6qAQe0,1,git for Data Science Made Simple...

530,530, We fail more then we success so Data Science is like real Science In Academia you only have high success to failure rate at low levels Once you get to new and complex things it can get hard Really hard And depressing Of course you can always be that lucky one and get your experiment parameters right in first go I used to be what a lot of people would think of as a real scientist the one that does experiments in a lab coat in a lab to discover and create new things A lot of things in Academia is presented as if the success was effortless nobody is showing the amount of work that went into it results from failed experiments rarely get published if at all One of my friends also has imposter syndrome I have different issues I am always hungry for knowledge and new things and I love solving problems also I'm unemployed atm so I can't have an imposter syndrome As for failures this is a normal part of the process I don't remember who said it but it went like this when you enter the a new uncharted territory when you try new things nobody did before everybody is underqualified for the job I think this is a huge part of what being a Scientist is you try to do new things and you fail and you learn from it and you try again Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't Some problems can't get solved at this stage maybe new tools theories new data need to appear first Sometimes it is too expensive to do what is needed to get a good solution maybe an approximation can be good enough I'd like to say that this is why you get paid the big bucks because it requires certain way of thinking intelligence and skills to solve problems To be a Scientist it ain't an easy job in general Sadly a lot of Scientists are really poorly payed And a lot of research is conducted in a very bad unproductive way but that's an off topic The job hunt IMO it is a bit of lottery And just because someone has amazing credentials doesn't necessarily mean they are amazing themselves I've worked with people that had PhDs from an university ranked in world's top 25 one of these people came even from a VERY VERY good research group and they were not living up to the standard I imagined The best Scientists I worked with came from UK university outside the country's top 10 and India Of course good credentials do help you to get a job That's why you should get them But also get the understanding of the things you are doing and the knowledge of the subject A PhD diploma is a proof a person wrote and defended a PhD it does not make someone a good Scientist Maybe it should but these are two different things I also heard words of wisdom that went like these don't compare yourself to other people you don't know their full story Compare the you of yesterday to the you of today I'm off with that this comment is getting too long Good video Ken ,UgwM0jjh6kHvyYrF7bh4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwuJkG2IxMrvSSCu0LWsiTg,hAgg,2,4,2020-10-16 19:53:58+00:00,Uf0dO-pgOrk,2,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),2020-10-16,fail success data science like real science academia high success failure rate low level get new complex thing get hard really hard depressing course always lucky one get experiment parameter right first go used lot people would think real scientist one experiment lab coat lab discover create new thing lot thing academia presented success effortless nobody showing amount work went result failed experiment rarely get published one friend also imposter syndrome different issue always hungry knowledge new thing love solving problem also i'm unemployed atm can't imposter syndrome failure normal part process remember said went like enter new uncharted territory try new thing nobody everybody underqualified job think huge part scientist try new thing fail learn try sometimes work sometimes problem can't get solved stage maybe new tool theory new data need appear first sometimes expensive needed get good solution maybe approximation good enough i'd like say get paid big buck requires certain way thinking intelligence skill solve problem scientist ain't easy job general sadly lot scientist really poorly payed lot research conducted bad unproductive way that's topic job hunt imo bit lottery someone amazing credential necessarily mean amazing i've worked people phd university ranked world's top 25 one people came even good research group living standard imagined best scientist worked came uk university outside country's top 10 india course good credential help get job that's get also get understanding thing knowledge subject phd diploma proof person wrote defended phd make someone good scientist maybe two different thing also heard word wisdom went like compare people know full story compare yesterday today i'm comment getting long good video ken

812,812,How Much Math do I need in Data Science Math skills are essential in data science and machine learning I Introduction If you are a data science aspirant you no doubt have the following questions in mind Can I become a data scientist with little or no math background What essential math skills are important in data science There are so many good packages that can be used for building predictive models or for producing data visualizations Some of the most common packages for descriptive and predictive analytics include Ggplot2 Matplotlib Seaborn Scikit learn Caret TensorFlow PyTorch Keras Thanks to these packages anyone can build a model or produce a data visualization However very solid background knowledge in mathematics is essential for fine tuning your models to produce reliable models with optimal performance It is one thing to build a model it is another thing to interpret the model and draw out meaningful conclusions that can be used for data driven decision making It s important that before using these packages you have an understanding of the mathematical basis of each that way you are not using these packages simply as black box tools II Case Study Building A Multiple Regression Model Let s suppose we are going to be building a multi regression model Before doing that we need to ask ourselves the following questions How big is my dataset What are my feature variables and target variable What predictor features correlate the most with the target variable What features are important Should I scale my features How should my dataset be partitioned into training and testing sets What is principal component analysis PCA Should I use PCA for removing redundant features How do I evaluate my model Should I used R2 score MSE or MAE How can I improve the predictive power of the model Should I use regularized regression models What are the regression coefficients What is the intercept Should I use non parametric regression models such as KNeighbors regression or support vector regression What are the hyperparameters in my model and how can they be fine tuned to obtain the model with optimal performance Without a sound math background you wouldn t be able to address the questions raised above The bottom line is that in data science and machine learning mathematical skills are as important as programming skills As a data science aspirant it is therefore essential that you invest time to study the theoretical and mathematical foundations of data science and machine learning Your ability to build reliable and efficient models that can be applied to real world problems depends on how good your mathematical skills are To see how math skills are applied in building a machine learning regression model please see this article Machine Learning Process Tutorial Let s now discuss some of the essential math skills needed in data science and machine learning III Essential Math Skills for Data Science and Machine Learning 1 Statistics and Probability Statistics and Probability is used for visualization of features data preprocessing feature transformation data imputation dimensionality reduction feature engineering model evaluation etc Here are the topics you need to be familiar with Mean Median Mode Standard deviation variance Correlation coefficient and the covariance matrix Probability distributions Binomial Poisson Normal p value Baye s Theorem Precision Recall Positive Predictive Value Negative Predictive Value Confusion Matrix ROC Curve Central Limit Theorem R 2 score Mean Square Error MSE A B Testing Monte Carlo Simulation 2 Multivariable Calculus Most machine learning models are built with a dataset having several features or predictors Hence familiarity with multivariable calculus is extremely important for building a machine learning model Here are the topics you need to be familiar with Functions of several variables Derivatives and gradients Step function Sigmoid function Logit function ReLU Rectified Linear Unit function Cost function Plotting of functions Minimum and Maximum values of a function 3 Linear Algebra Linear algebra is the most important math skill in machine learning A data set is represented as a matrix Linear algebra is used in data preprocessing data transformation dimensionality reduction and model evaluation Here are the topics you need to be familiar with Vectors Norm of a vector Matrices Transpose of a matrix The inverse of a matrix The determinant of a matrix Trace of a Matrix Dot product Eigenvalues Eigenvectors 4 Optimization Methods Most machine learning algorithms perform predictive modeling by minimizing an objective function thereby learning the weights that must be applied to the testing data in order to obtain the predicted labels Here are the topics you need to be familiar with Cost function Objective function Likelihood function Error function Gradient Descent Algorithm and its variants e g Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm IV Summary and Conclusion In summary we ve discussed the essential math and theoretical skills that are needed in data science and machine learning There are several free online courses that will teach you the necessary math skills that you need in data science and machine learning As a data science aspirant it s important to keep in mind that the theoretical foundations of data science are very crucial for building efficient and reliable models You should therefore invest enough time to study the mathematical theory behind each machine

2173,2173,Hello all and Mr Ken Jee It is very humble of Mr Ken to just have a light eye the person who copied his work I am a learning individual myself I do visit kaggle and github but to just get an idea of how the person has solved the problem and then i take almost one to two weeks to come up with my own unique solution Solving takes time Learn from elders and create something on your own Again Mr Ken is being very much liberal here But you will face a big issue when you go for Masters or research jobs You will get caught and it won't look good One other thing that Mr Ken did not address of course he doesn't want to scare the young ones is that a company hold power to blacklist you after being caught of fraud This means that you won't be able to apply for that company for upto 3 years or forever depending on the policy and also the company can suggest your blacklisted profiles to partner organizations and you will be totally screwed Shadow learning is something very important to learn Shadows learning suggests learning the first principles from others works This means learning the thought process and not copying the core work Most of the researchers have 2 ways of reaching a new success One is making something better or creating something new Shadow learning is something Einstein has done it himself He worked as a clerk in a patent office for years going through the research papers or maxwell's newtons etc Did he copy Absoluetly not When he found out that he was a bit lagging in the math section of E MC 2 he contacted maxwell for his expertise on the derivations That's how we have Einsein Maxwells Equation See Einstein himself wasn't shy of giving credit to the fellow scientists Why should kids like us be shy of mentioning a partner or co worker or the sources name or the persons name Have an open mind like newton Let the apple fall and create something new Cheers and All the best People are good but people who share credits are great Peace ,UgzaGx3BiuVHLikqiWR4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwTNOvHusTm7uo-IZR_FAIQ,supreet chivukula,1,1,2020-08-08 06:31:38+00:00,vQGJvmhpq_s,1,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,2020-08-08,hello mr ken jee humble mr ken light eye person copied work learning individual visit kaggle github get idea person solved problem take almost one two week come unique solution solving take time learn elder create something mr ken much liberal face big issue go master research job get caught look good one thing mr ken address course want scare young one company hold power blacklist caught fraud mean able apply company upto 3 year forever depending policy also company suggest blacklisted profile partner organization totally screwed shadow learning something important learn shadow learning suggests learning first principle others work mean learning thought process copying core work researcher 2 way reaching new success one making something better creating something new shadow learning something einstein done worked clerk patent office year going research paper maxwell's newton etc copy absoluetly found bit lagging math section e mc 2 contacted maxwell expertise derivation that's einsein maxwell equation see einstein shy giving credit fellow scientist kid like u shy mentioning partner co worker source name person name open mind like newton let apple fall create something new cheer best people good people share credit great peace

2203,2203,Great topic and good video I think you set the appropriate tone overall I believe most people learn by copying following along mimicry whatever it is called at first I know that I have reproduced projects for the sake of learning Now when I follow along with someone's project I find it REALLY helpful to state where it came from on top This way I know where it came from and can return to the original material later if need be My personal thinking is that many many many did I say 'many' enough people forget the internet is open to a fault ,UgwA0pUvVqrww3AFN2d4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkIkc77YacDWe1ieUFpMsFQ,Matt Curcio,1,2,2020-08-07 17:06:44+00:00,vQGJvmhpq_s,1,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,2020-08-07,great topic good video think set appropriate tone overall believe people learn copying following along mimicry whatever called first know reproduced project sake learning follow along someone's project find really helpful state came top way know came return original material later need personal thinking many many many say 'many' enough people forget internet open fault
2204,2204,This is a very important topic I agree As you have said using someone else's code is very common in DS or just tech in general however it is important to credit the people correctly Some people may think I could have written that code myself which can of course be true in some situations but I like to think that using code is at least somewhat comparable to quoting in literature If you use a normal sentence such as the weather was nice obviously you don't need to quote anyone But if you want to use a longer paragraph of text or code in that matter it is very important to show the source Now in literature this is made pretty easy by placing quotation marks and just referencing the author but because code stays below the surface in many areas plagiarism can go unnoticed for far longer even though it is not less important to credit people in tech than it is in literature Thank you for making this video and bringing a bit of light onto this topic I think this is something which should be made very clear Edit When writing I just noticed that it makes a lot of sense for one's self to give proper credit as well As you said it makes people happy to see their code being used well So if you give proper credit you not only make yourself feel good because you did the right thing but also the creator because their work was used and they got credit On the other hand if you don't credit you feel bad for plagiarizing and the other person becomes angry because of it So giving proper credit is basically a win win ,UgzdoraYnEIrmKc53jZ4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXOdh3pTBBovDXzkUkTuvKA,Boris Giba,1,1,2020-08-07 16:41:34+00:00,vQGJvmhpq_s,1,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,2020-08-07,important topic agree said using someone else's code common d tech general however important credit people correctly people may think could written code course true situation like think using code least somewhat comparable quoting literature use normal sentence weather nice obviously need quote anyone want use longer paragraph text code matter important show source literature made pretty easy placing quotation mark referencing author code stay surface many area plagiarism go unnoticed far longer even though le important credit people tech literature thank making video bringing bit light onto topic think something made clear edit writing noticed make lot sense one's self give proper credit well said make people happy see code used well give proper credit make feel good right thing also creator work used got credit hand credit feel bad plagiarizing person becomes angry giving proper credit basically win win

2212,2212,Thank you for this informative video Sir this is truly helpful to young inexperienced present and soon to become data scientists such as myself As far as plagiarism goes with respect to code I have a question I'm sure that even on the internet there are some niche common and popular data sets which are considered to be the kind of must do's for new data scientists In such a scenario its probable that 2 entirely different unrelated and isolated data scientists decide to use the exact same methodology to analyze the data in such scenarios how should one go about giving the due credit to the people who have already employed similar if not the same method for analysis Additionally on a completely unrelated note I have a school level class 11th and 12th high school coding competition coming up comprising of 2 rounds The first one being questions related to coding and java python and c and the 2nd round being solving 3 real world problems using code under the span of 1 hour The second round is purely python coding based I only know vanilla python well most of the general functions and methods and have no experience with either java or c I was thinking of learning some modules I've briefly learned the foundations of throughout high school such as numpy math csv and either pyqt5 or tkinter Do you have any tips for me that could help me win this competition Its my first coding competition and I want to test myself against other coders from other schools and most of all see if my efforts have borne fruit Any tips or other modules I should revise or learn would be extremely helpful Finally I have one last question I've researched this quite a bit on both YouTube and the internet through articles but I haven't found any satisfactory answer to a question What's it like to be a Data Scientist I'm not asking the work schedule or when a DS wakes up what he she does at the start of the day and then what they do at work and after returning home what work do they do related to DS I want to know what is a data science life in general what do you do on off days how much me time do you get what kind of holidays do you get to connect with friends and families and just take it easy and take a break from work I'm eager to know the life side of work life balance with regards to being a data scientist Sorry if the comment is a bit too long its just that for me you are the only working professional and mentor figure I can ask these kinds of questions I'll be really glad if you respond And again thank you for making these videos they are a huge help ,UgyXRA0TIvEDPPPQazZ4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKf0pIXi1GL6LYL-qCyKm_w,Jai Gaurav,3,1,2020-08-07 15:39:29+00:00,vQGJvmhpq_s,3,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,2020-08-07,thank informative video sir truly helpful young inexperienced present soon become data scientist far plagiarism go respect code question i'm sure even internet niche common popular data set considered kind must do's new data scientist scenario probable 2 entirely different unrelated isolated data scientist decide use exact methodology analyze data scenario one go giving due credit people already employed similar method analysis additionally completely unrelated note school level class 11th 12th high school coding competition coming comprising 2 round first one question related coding java python c 2nd round solving 3 real world problem using code span 1 hour second round purely python coding based know vanilla python well general function method experience either java c thinking learning module i've briefly learned foundation throughout high school numpy math csv either pyqt5 tkinter tip could help win competition first coding competition want test coder school see effort borne fruit tip module revise learn would extremely helpful finally one last question i've researched quite bit youtube internet article found satisfactory answer question what's like data scientist i'm asking work schedule d wake start day work returning home work related d want know data science life general day much time get kind holiday get connect friend family take easy take break work i'm eager know life side work life balance regard data scientist sorry comment bit long working professional mentor figure ask kind question i'll really glad respond thank making video huge help

3006,3006,Hi Ken Jee thanks for the great content I decided around March that I wanted to make a career change into data science and quickly realized it was going to take a lot longer than I originally thought Although I have a degree in aerospace engineering I have been working in sales for the past 8 years so my technical skills weren't where they needed to be Anyways after doing some research I came to the conclusion that starting out in a data analyst role might be a more attainable path for me because of my lack of experience and that form there I could transition into data science once I have real world experience My question for you is do you believe entering the industry as a data analyst is a good way to do it Also do you have any tips for writing a good resume when you don't have experience I have been taking online courses in SQL and Python and feel pretty proficient in SQL but not so much in Python still need to work more on that Thanks again for the great content I appreciate the hard work you've put into sharing your knowledge ,Ugy42o0yB68rann12_N4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa7yfBy9kf-ET06R4WN3ulA,Alvaro Fierro,1,2,2020-07-10 22:20:52+00:00,n3vw0M5RrPU,1,How I Learned Data Science,2020-07-10,hi ken jee thanks great content decided around march wanted make career change data science quickly realized going take lot longer originally thought although degree aerospace engineering working sale past 8 year technical skill needed anyways research came conclusion starting data analyst role might attainable path lack experience form could transition data science real world experience question believe entering industry data analyst good way also tip writing good resume experience taking online course sql python feel pretty proficient sql much python still need work thanks great content appreciate hard work put sharing knowledge

3011,3011,I found this video to be extremely basic and vague and the video doesn't quite match the contents you show very expensive components and then speak how it's not really necessary to have powerful PC for beginners The general recommendations are fine but there is no explanation as for when and why you would want to get anything better than Ryzen 5 What tasks are particularly CPU focused and will benefit noticeably from e g Ryzen 9 processor If it can save you several hours of computing a day it can be a big deal but if it says less than a hour it's mostly pointless The same goes for graphic card Nvidia RTX Titan seems extremely overpriced for what it does From what I can tell it's only slightly better than RTX 2080 Ti and cots twice as much Is there even any reason to get it Maybe some additional optimization for Data Science tasks So far it looks extremely cost ineffective even for highest end PC Might as well get something cheaper for now and then upgrade to RTX 3000 when it launches Again unless it can save several hours of computing every day I don't see how it makes any sense at all Additionally I wonder how impactful RAM memory speed is for Data Science tasks Does it make sense to overclock your RAM or is it just a waste of time and effort Finally I'm not sure if it's correct to simply ignore Motherboard and PSU You listed a 500 PC and then you mentioned 200 for motherboard and other components which practically increases the price by 50 Again depending on how important storage speed is it might make sense to get a more expensive motherboard such as B550 or X570 However if it's not as important and regular NVME SSD is more than good enough then good B450 board is plenty powerful As for storage Samsung NVME SSDs are way overpriced so I wouldn't recommend one personally Good ADATA NVME costs just 70 75 for 500 GB and is only marginally slower My recommended budget build based in my understanding will depend on the country but in short here doesn't seem to be any significant differences from general gaming build recommendations For processor I'd get Ryzen 5 1600 AF if it's available for under 110 otherwise Ryzen 5 3600 is the best choice For memory if speed is not super important for Data Science tasks I'd recommend Crucial Ballistix Black 2x8 GB 3200 MHz Even if it is this kit has good overclocking capabilities Wouldn't get anything below 16 GB as Chrome is a memory hog and you likely need a lot of tabs open for data science projects For motherboard I'd recommend B450 Mortar Max or Tomahawk Max as those support upgradability For cheaper options B450 PRO VDH Max is also good For SSD ADATA SX8200 Pro 500 1000 GB is the best choice depending on your preferences regarding regularly cleaning your PC I wouldn't get anything below 500 GB myself since this will likely cause major inconveniences For PSU anything 550 650W is good enough I wouldn't get anything below Gold certification if your PC runs for 10 hours every day If available at reasonable price Deepcool DQ 650M is a good choice Monitor doesn't really matter for Data Science so anything cheap and sturdy will do Graphic card is a tricky one I'd probably try to look for a good used option for a budget build but it's hard to find a reliable seller I assume Nvidia cards are easier to use for Data Science as AMD cars get less support Used GTX 1060 6GB is a bare minimum I'd recommend but if you can afford a more expensive one 2070 Super looks like an optimal choice in terms of cost to performance Personally I'd get 1060 and then upgrade to RTX 3070 when available As for the case anything above 60 should be fine Got myself new MSI MAG case it's quite runs pretty old and comes with fans already pre installed More premium options are Phantex P400A and Meshify C Secondary components like motherboard PSU and case may seem unimportant but they ultimately affect performance reliability upgradability and longevity of the system as we Still would like to know how important memory speed is for Data science tasks 16 GB 2400 MHz and 16 GB 3800 MHz are 2 completely different kits for some tasks

3535,3535,Fist of all thank you for your time making this series It casted a lot of light to me on the big scheme of things in a project how you handle it as a whole Most resources deal just with certain parts so they miss the big picture I'm having a hard time I'm trying to get ready a data set cleaning inputing binning etc i wrote individual functions that take the full dataframe as input and outputs it with the respective transformation inputation Resources mention that is good practice to write functions So i did Then i stumble across custom transformers now I'm trying to create one to use it rather than the individual functions What is the difference between using lambda funcitons like in here and creating the custom transfomers Is it good to write one transformer that will deal with all the steps cleaning custom value inputing changing types of values discretizing aggregating categories etc etc to get my dataset ready Or what am i supposed to do Then i would like to use it in a pipeline to finish with encoding and scaling I'm kinda lost and can't find any good resource to solve this Thank so much you and keep the good work ,UgzDA0YtTl1czFLc0M14AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcyGe-7yAUpRD4nhqnJsiRg,Daniel Guerra,2,1,2020-06-15 21:22:50+00:00,fhi4dOhmW-g,2,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),2020-06-15,fist thank time making series casted lot light big scheme thing project handle whole resource deal certain part miss big picture i'm hard time i'm trying get ready data set cleaning inputing binning etc wrote individual function take full dataframe input output respective transformation inputation resource mention good practice write function stumble across custom transformer i'm trying create one use rather individual function difference using lambda funcitons like creating custom transfomers good write one transformer deal step cleaning custom value inputing changing type value discretizing aggregating category etc etc get dataset ready supposed would like use pipeline finish encoding scaling i'm kinda lost can't find good resource solve thank much keep good work

3540,3540,Nice video I'm not familiar with your channel but saw the thumbnail its length and clicked through a few other ideas resources to choose from that I think can be really helpful for beginners depending on how they like to learn 1 Make a habit of partitioning off a small portion of your learning time to do some light reading on best practices this is softer information and can often be more subjective than the harder skills but it can be extremely helpful in adding context to why certain things are the way they are and potentially help save you some cleanup down the road things like docstrings virtual environments project directory structure etc Like everything else this can be overwhelming and my advice would also be to choose one thing at a time and start trying to build it into your workflow docstrings and virtual environments are both good examples of things that take a little getting used to but can feel very fluid after a short period of time and save a lot of headaches with package managers if you're using vscode or PyCharm the autodocstrings are great and keep your time spent doing the things the machine can't not playing with margins 2 Listening to podcasts about the subject IMO is also extremely valuable and can be done on the go even if as a beginner you don't understand much that they're talking about hearing others talk about common problems before you get to them can help you understand what's happening more quickly whenever you do Additionally a huge part of this field is learning how to articulate the problem you're trying to solve for on google stack and listening to podcasts can help you learn how to articulate things better both verbally and in writing I'm much less familiar with the R podcast landscape but for Python beginners Talk Python To Me is great for slightly deeper dives into a specific problem domain and Python Bytes is good fun weekly exposure to the evolving packaging landscape 2 1 Quick addition to the above point another thing it can really help with is understanding the extent to which most problems particularly on the data processing cleansing wrangling front have already been solved for I've often seen more novice programmers try to recreate the wheel at every turn and hearing more experienced people unpack how they approach problem solving can help save you from writing a script to do something that's part of a standard library 3 Time spent finding the right resources is never time wasted in addition to paid courses etc I'd encourage finding someone on Youtube similar who does a good job of articulating things in a way that makes sense to you Corey Schafer has a fantastic Python channel covering everything from basics best practices to end to end application development 4 Acknowledging that this would fall somewhere towards the latter half of the progression outlined in your video I think it's super worth calling out that all the services we use personally have open APIs from which we can programmatically extract our data from and can be a great way to build out your mechanics in a fun more personal way it's also a natural and safer step towards web scraping since it's all the same communication protocol Amongst many others Spotify has a super user friendly API and a well supported helper library called Spotipy for anyone who might like this idea and be looking for a place to start Python beginnings to start learning how APIs work Again great video and I hope the data dump's welcomed

3773,3773,I think learning by doing is a wonderful fun and efficient way to learn a range of skills HOWEVER after 40 years developing for large medium and small commercial non profit military defense and other companies across communications strategic data media AI quantum AI full stack and other areas I have also seen the dangers of that as a primary let alone singular learning approach People who learn exclusive via doing especially working predominately on their own while eschewing theory and complementary skills prior to that approach often have major applied theory and application context gaps in their knowledge that they appear generally unaware of Obviously this depends whether you are learning predominately on your own or if you have guide s mentor s and or teacher s that help point out short comings and gaps in your knowledge base and approaches There are multiple factors underlying this problem First it is very hard for most people to deeply self introspect to see where they lie on broad based external knowledge continuums without significant sources of historical theoretical and contextual reference This is why the first factor of where people are on the Dunning Kruger curve skews left with people who have largely self educated without a broader base of external references as noted above The second factor is the fact that most of the time most people simply do not know what they don t know In other words it takes a broad base of external theoretical historical and contextual learning to develop metacognitive skills to help us intuit where we have gaps in our knowledge base and to consistently discern correct from incorrect conclusions While working on our own is a great way to learn deep practical skills we see that it often comes along with blinders to broader alternative views and approaches In other words you can easily be unwittingly blind to the fact that your toolbox is mostly bare and that you don t know how to optimally use even the tools you do have For example we see people who have never heard of Donald E Knuth JADD or Charles Petzold that have instead learned simply by doing who code using approaches that others have long since bypassed resulting in programming that causes problems and often must be rewritten and projects that must be taken over by other groups ideally prior to them causing real world problems in the end user community So while there is no substitute for hands on learning and many have succeeded in becoming gainfully employed as programmers without much classical computer programming training or academic education even hands on learning approaches work better in the form of a balanced apprenticeship approach where you work autonomously but under the direction and oversight of someone much more knowledgeable and skilled than yourself The fact is that the number of software developers on the planet doubles every 5 years As such by definition this means that half of software developers have less than 5 years experience The number goes down as you get to more specialized areas of knowledge that increasingly can have a broad based impact in unforeseen ways on the future of humanity For example the number of AI programmers is doubling every 12 14 months and is still falling This means that on average AI programmers have a year or less programming skills in AI Increasingly the percentage that have any significant general programming or computer science education is dropping as the demand for AI programmers is far outstripping what our universities and training centers can provide As such more people are self educating often by jumping in and doing prior to getting any significant training Sadly many of us who don t get the academic knowledge and theory up front never go back later to address that since they get too busy and immerse in immediate needs So the gaps and deficiencies upon entering the workforce often are carried throughout their carrier Often they become highly proficient programmers and such in whatever language s they happen to need for the tasks at hand but they often don t learn to intuit when for example they should turn to something like Node js versus Python or use Matlab vs Tensorflow etc So what is the negative result of people learning predominately hands on rather than under the oversight of others who are significantly more knowledgeable and skilled and preferably with a good foundation of theory and broad based learning to bolster their metacognitive theory and analytical skills development The result is that suboptimal approaches zero hour bugs and higher rates of failed projects as defined by the failure to meet one or more primary deliverables as defined by the final SOW Further as AI is integrating to the very fabric of our digital world we are seeing a wide range of badly trained and architected systems that are leading to avoidable deaths flash crashes in major global markets just in time delivery system failures and much more We know the causes of these are often programmers who are being primarily trained autonomous hands on approaches So given that traditional education in the form of BS MS and PhD s in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people from a financial standpoint what are the alternatives First online learning when done in conjunction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful high utility educational base Further programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in Also as AI is integrating to the very fabric of our digital world we are seeing a wide range of badly trained and architected systems that are leading to avoidable deaths flash crashes in major global markets just in time delivery system failures and much more We know the causes of these are often programmers who are being primarily trained autonomous hands on approaches So given that traditional education in the form of BS MS and PhD s in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people what are the alternatives First online learning when done in conjuction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful way to learn Further programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in For example say you spent a few hundred hours learning and taking on a few projects in Python and Swift You should also read several of the seminal computer programming theory and related books at the very least in the areas you are focusing on and preferably add to them over time once you have internalized their benefit Statistics repeatedly show that people who never learned core theory prior to beginning a career have a much lower chance of ever learning those areas Similarly it can be a great boon to identify a local universities or a company that needs interns where you can work under and along side others with different skills While the pay may be minimal or non existent EVERYONE self taught university skilled and all other modalities of learning should intern just as is done in other mission critical and related fields like medicine And it is a LOT cheaper than the college alternative In medicine it is done on top of 6 9 years of additional post university graduation education while in computer programming a rapidly increasing percentage never even get any post graduation training of any significant merit let alone intern apprenticeship training Is professional programming any less deep or broad of an area of knowledge Not if you want to excel in terms of being at least well rounded and far more employable than average and definitely not if you wish to excel in skills compensation and job satisfaction So don t migrate primarily to hands on without getting a good base of other approaches behind you because statistically you probably will never go back to rectify the competency knowledge and related gaps you create by doing so

4486,4486,Best advice from a data scientist 1 nothing is what it seems If you have yet to enter the data science and analyst field still in school or studying what you think a data scientist is day to day is wrong So keep an open mind We re not writing algorithms on the windows of dorm rooms Hint 90 of our work is research and data preparation cleaning If you want to be a kick ass data scientist learn how to interview data users Coding is the easy part 2 did I say be open minded Good Now tell yourself over and over and over almost no companies know what data science is And neither do you So let me tell you what data science is it s the ability to understand and manipulate data and or information That s it Data science is not Python If I give you an excel sheet of data and ask you to create a pivot that shows me counts and sums of those counts and you do that you are being a data scientist Your ability to code in a certain language does not data science I m telling you this cause being and looking this internet conceived data scientist part person is a misconception and can kill your dream of ever growing into a great data scientist Give yourself credit for what you know And be confident that because you can analyze data in excel you can also learn object oriented programming 3 nothing is what it seems Just cause a job title doesn t say data scientist doesn t mean your not going to do data science work I m a business intelligence developer I manage data from Oracle SQL Server and Cloud data lakes When I sit down at my desk I open Dbeaver SQL Server Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook All these IDE s get used daily That means I coding in 3 languages at a minimum daily ONLY ONE of those languages is Python My job title is NOT data scientist My point in all my rubbish talk is that data science is a lot like the cloud Over 10 years ago the cloud concept became the rage And yet most companies are still struggling to implement or even leverage the cloud Data science is sadly going down that path too Most companies and their managers are posting jobs to hire data scientists and as long as the job posting has a requirement of must know Python it s a data scientist job posting However 99 of the managers hiring data scientist don t know what a data scientist is themselves And those managers couldn t tell you what a Jupyter notebook is Or how to write print hello world in Python Yet they re interviewing candidates for Python development If and when you enter the so called data scientist career path be open minded This is a journey not a goal Enjoy the trip Be flexible Knowledge trumps job titles If you want to get paid the big bucks be the most valuable player That means work on everything sent your way And show off your skills Good luck ,Ugzb1fCulqpJm9blNmV4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAgZlr1u3Wb7sYJ9BmvS_fg,Michael Redfern,1,0,2020-05-17 14:05:21+00:00,4OZip0cgOho,1,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),2020-05-17,best advice data scientist 1 nothing seems yet enter data science analyst field still school studying think data scientist day day wrong keep open mind writing algorithm window dorm room hint 90 work research data preparation cleaning want kick as data scientist learn interview data user coding easy part 2 say open minded good tell almost company know data science neither let tell data science ability understand manipulate data information data science python give excel sheet data ask create pivot show count sum count data scientist ability code certain language data science telling cause looking internet conceived data scientist part person misconception kill dream ever growing great data scientist give credit know confident analyze data excel also learn object oriented programming 3 nothing seems cause job title say data scientist mean going data science work business intelligence developer manage data oracle sql server cloud data lake sit desk open dbeaver sql server visual studio jupyter notebook ide get used daily mean coding 3 language minimum daily one language python job title data scientist point rubbish talk data science lot like cloud 10 year ago cloud concept became rage yet company still struggling implement even leverage cloud data science sadly going path company manager posting job hire data scientist long job posting requirement must know python data scientist job posting however 99 manager hiring data scientist know data scientist manager tell jupyter notebook write print hello world python yet interviewing candidate python development enter called data scientist career path open minded journey goal enjoy trip flexible knowledge trump job title want get paid big buck valuable player mean work everything sent way show skill good luck

5601,5601,First off it is good to know that I am getting into the field and not for the wrong reasons Thanks for the insight Having committed myself to securing my spot in a masters in data science program at Denver I think the number one driving factor in why I am even pursuing this field is I honestly believe there is a science to social interaction and I believe there can be an algorithm that can be created and used in conjunction with therapy for those who struggle with making friends dating establishing relationships and even have difficulty developing APPROPRIATE humor I have always wondered how some people can easily make friends seem to easily talk with women and enter into relationships with ease and how some people can have a sense of humor that gives off positive energy and draws people towards them Then there are those that no matter how in shape they get how good they may become at a given sport they may try all sorts of meetup groups yet every attempt to make new friends seems futile Making matters worse these people who struggle may try and utilize humor only to end up being making more of a fool of themselves This by no means will be an easy project and will require the skill sets acquired from a masters program and even more and it will probably involve doing a number of large surveys and even designing an interface that can measure speech patterns and measure non verbal body communication among several other variables such as proper clothing color selection ones facial attractiveness ones health status disabilities to name just a few I feel an algorithm involving highly complex mathematics that can be implemented in therapy may be the answer to curing the loneliness epidemic reducing addiction as a result of loneliness and decrease mortality related to loneliness I am sure this is bordering if not even getting into the field of artificial intelligence There is a science to successful social interaction and it's time to dig deep into the data ,UgxVIPK5HqAMQZ1ubjl4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3VGE_oMmD3qzI9yEco0I1w,Downhill D Miller,1,6,2019-12-17 00:33:45+00:00,m5pwx3hgtzM,1,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,2019-12-17,first good know getting field wrong reason thanks insight committed securing spot master data science program denver think number one driving factor even pursuing field honestly believe science social interaction believe algorithm created used conjunction therapy struggle making friend dating establishing relationship even difficulty developing appropriate humor always wondered people easily make friend seem easily talk woman enter relationship ease people sense humor give positive energy draw people towards matter shape get good may become given sport may try sort meetup group yet every attempt make new friend seems futile making matter worse people struggle may try utilize humor end making fool mean easy project require skill set acquired master program even probably involve number large survey even designing interface measure speech pattern measure non verbal body communication among several variable proper clothing color selection one facial attractiveness one health status disability name feel algorithm involving highly complex mathematics implemented therapy may answer curing loneliness epidemic reducing addiction result loneliness decrease mortality related loneliness sure bordering even getting field artificial intelligence science successful social interaction time dig deep data
